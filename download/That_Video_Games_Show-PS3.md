foreign starting our life on the PlayStation 2 the Yakuza series is consistently Innovative and managed to stay relevant right up until this day there's been many sequels and spin-offs that help solidify the franchise's success but one lesser known entry that deserves way more attention than a God is your Cruiser dead salt it's a huge departure from the usual formula you'd expect that instead takes on the form of a sort of arcade shooter it's not only the gameplay that's different however the story is also a change from what the games are known for it revolves around four separate chapters that each star a specific character fans will know and love each chapter sees you fighting through wave after wave of enemies as you hope to eventually reach the city limits and ultimately your safety as you would expect you're given a wide range of Weaponry in order to achieve this goal may be a standard pistol or a dual wielding shotguns there's a ton of ways to approach each swarm of zombies you'll need to utilize all of the options at your disposal is the hordes of Relentless and pose a meaningful threat as you make your way through the adventure the spice fans up even further there's also the inclusion and special abilities let's see teaming up with a partner to score some serious damage there's quite a few of them for each character such as throwing several grenades of the enemy and shooting them just as they land each of them are a real spectacle and managed to add a distinct amount of style to the combat that helps it flow even better to top all of this off you've also got the inclusion in several minigames like Yakuza is well known for such as karaoke or darts to help mix up the gameplay even further by providing a few engaging ways to pass the time if you're a fan of the series this one is a no-brainer and likewise for those who enjoy arcade Shooters there is plenty to love 3D dog game he rose is a unique action adventure that takes a huge inspiration for likes of Zelda specifically the first game of the NES where there was a real focus on open environments that moved from screen to screen even the story shares some similarities as it's set up that long ago the sages used their power to seal away of great evil now in the present evil has returned it's up to you to obtain that power of banquet ship the basic structure of the gameplay sees you exploring the world map solving dungeons to recover orbs of power and gain the equippable items along the way that let you access new areas and perform new moves budget plays a somewhat bigger role and is more involving than most Zelda games as opposed to depleting it by the lighter in a lantern or charger in a Spin Attack you consume it by activating spells that you learn throughout the game there are several of them and unlike in some games most of them are absolutely required to progress and the ones that aren't incredibly useful when used strategically you might do damage to enemies freeze an area or slow down time which all come in hand handy against the surprisingly challenging white supposit how visually is the title of game itself in place the game's Graphics are all composed of 3D dots the idea being to take the pixelated look of classic NES games and updating it and it was sort of 3D version you'll find that it is also a lot of charm to be found not to mention a character editor and we're not talking about selecting from a set of designs tweaking them you get to create your entire character out little blocks in 3D from the ground up including colors different poses you name it all in all 3D job Game Heroes flawlessly takes an old games design and reduce it this one is well worth picking up if you can find it on the cheap for long time fans of the channel you'll likely already be aware of my unhealthy obsession with Ridge Racer while it's nowhere near the best racing game series you'll find on the PS3 is definitely one of the most enjoyable due to its easy pickup and play Arcade nature is with most racing games that made meat and potatoes of the game lies in the championship mode and here you are met with a series of tracks to race around them that whilst in the new cars and parts along the way this is one of the finest aspects of the game as it provides a deep system for car fans to fine-tune their car and take advantage of the several benefits they offer it's not only faster speeds but you can also earn AIDs that can help out such as bumpy rental cars resulting in taking less per hit the true star of the show however is the gameplay itself its arcade approach opens it up to players of all ages and skill levels but at the same time offers up a drifting system That's essential to master in order to complete some of the more challenging races to gain Frozen you've drifting through a tight Corner as the music blasts and the announcer everyone is a feeling that just never got sold once we've got it down adding to the racing is the Nitro system which intricately ties into the upgrade option shall unlock along the way there's several types available with the most common being a gauge that is made up of 3D section as you drift around each course the gauge slowly Rises and allows you to find this hyper one part or your whole gauge as you please there's several variations on this that give it different effects such as being able to build the gauge quickly while offering faster speeds for fewer sections of the bar overall Ridge Racer 7 is by no means the best racing game you'll find on the PlayStation 3 but with its style gameplay impressive visuals and Battery smooth performance is one that deserves a look especially for fans of the series and if the genre is full PlayStation 3 had a huge selection solid RPGs to play but one that never truly received the attention it deserved has to be full plot this game's story is one of mystery the main characters Alan and cleats are both brought to the strange town that do them for different reasons by and large the gameplay is split into two different types with folklore's seven chapters with each of the protagonists in the beginning of a chapter you will sniff up Clues and suit answers for our durian Village and when Nikon shall be transported to a realm of The Surreal never will where you must fight your way through to the people levels boss in these Realms your character will encounter folks you must battle them and discover their group points and there's about a hundred of these beasts each of them all requiring a different approach once you've defeated a folk you can absorb its soul and doing so Grant you their power to wield and Southern clothes I love folklore's story but I think my favorite part of the game is using provokes in battle there is so many of them and they are each so different you get to choose which ones you want to use by assigning them to the base buttons and with a simple tap friendly men to the field they're from folks have specific elements they exhibit via bundle wind or fire for example and certain creatures are susceptible to certain elements and abused robbers this adds a ton of strategy to even the most mundane of Campus which helps to come back itself overall folklore is a game with an intriguing and mysterious story along with solid and fluent template the graphics are extremely artistic and easy on the ice and it has enough extra content to keep you playing quite some time to cope Tales of exilia introduces players to the Lush floating world of Reyes maxia a world made up of two states who find themselves on the Brentwood wall the populace of the world is full of people that rely on the power of spirits to use everyday Goods whether it be for light or activating Machinery so naturally they play a major role in the story which sees you taking up the role of one of two characters either Jude or Miller both tell what is essentially the same story but with a few deviations that promotes an extra playthrough once you're done when it comes to gameplay those familiar with the series will know the tales of franchise Prides itself on its action-based Combat gameplay like many other RPGs battles begin when the player character touches an enemy roaming around on the map and shifts to a circle Arena hitting a party of up to four characters against their opponents combat consists of stringing together combos using the x button for quick TP generating attacks and the circle button for classes special attacks known as Arts that consume TP this system works perfectly and incentivizes the required to keep up the pressure during combat which results in some truly exhilarating battles if xylia was the first Tales game to actually be made for the Playstation 3 and unfortunately it shows it just doesn't stand technically the main Cooperative texture started just woefully and detailed than just flat out playing at times but on the other hand the artistic vision of the game more than bets up the shortcomings using an oil painting style with Dave's World almost seems like a painting on the wall that is expertly crafted each local feels unique whether you visit one of the many cities or the snowy recesses of the highest peak and thankfully the performance remains solid at 60 frames per second during fights and in all honesty this is where the game truly comes into its own while it has a few issues Tales of Xillia is one of the better Tales games out there a great RPG in general if you like jrpgs and have a PlayStation 3 I strongly recommend giving this game a try after the huge success of the first game the sequel to implements was a polygon conclusion and released two years later he once again saw players jumping into the shoes of Cole McGrath he loses a long-anticipated battle with his greatest enemy the Beast and subsequently escapes to the newly introduced Locale of numerate an elastic attempt to boost its powers what's more is that the story takes some surprise and twists and turns the perfectly progress depending on the choices you've made will lead to completely different endings while being an open world game only playing on the story missions will allow you to progress towards the conclusion but there are thousands of side missions to do and builds to Flat doing all of these things is very fun thanks to the various and Visually stimulated superpowers of Cole's disposal Paul's Amplified body allows him to shoot lots of electricity out of his hands and enemies toss electric grenades for wide range damage blew people away with his stunning blasts that will also reflect Rockets a much much more aside from combat elements the biggest part of Infamous 2 is exploration Uber Ray is big but Cole has ways to get around quickly you can slide down telephone wires to quickly move from one place to the max or grab one of the charged vertical poles and Cole will launch himself High into the air it feels incredibly smooth just bolting around the city which helps them flow quite nicely finally the biggest aspect of the game is the karma system in almost every situation you have a choice do you assume the role of hero to a desperate City or do you live up to your name as a demon colon locks his best powers while becoming either a hero or an Infamous villain it's Saving Grace though is that the story plays out quite differently and the game gives you plenty of incentives to complete it twice such as trophies and hard difficulty Infamous 2 proves itself is an excellent sequence with already unique game fun combat and engaging Story full art style beautiful soundtrack and tons to do made this a worthwhile ride everyone should take Puppeteer is a spectacular platforming experience for the PlayStation 3.

unfortunately it got overlooked by many it's a shame too because it is truly one of the most inventive enjoyable and totally original side scrollers of all time developed by Japan Studio it's a sort of throwback to the platform as a whole such as Clockwork Knighton for Noah and the bizarre story really sets the stage quite literally for an unforgettable and dramatic Adventure it all kicks off with the main villain known as the bear King who kidnaps a boy named kritaru ultimately turning him into a wooden puppet and take him his head katara's quest to find his head and escaped the grasp of the bacon takes place on a stage of a puppet show complete with mechanical sets curtains and a visual audience as with most Platformers the game is split up into a series of levels that slowly ramp up the difficulty the Fairview regrets but kataru's got a few tricks up his sleeve to help even the odds the main one being a pair of scissors that you can use to attack enemies and essentially flip through the air while cousin items or enemies made of fabric or paper for cutting connected some guy used to and is honestly unlike anything I can remember playing in a platformer the inventive stages and set pieces in combination with these scissors made with some incredibly interesting and memorable puzzles of boss fights that's meant Puppeteer is one of the best Platformers on the PlayStation 3. as unique pistol gameplay is the creative visuals presented in Puppeteer are just as mind-blowing at times there's a clear amount of love that went into designing each and every aspect of the game from the characters to each individual stage I'll come across it's got a unique look that I can call its own if you fancy jumping into a platformer like no other then look no further than puppeteer the bulk of heavenly swords gameplay sees you taking up the Fighter's naracoat that she wields the heaven so there are three different stances with which naroko can wield the Heavenly sought there is a rage stance where the sword is whipped around with changed to strike groups of bows and clear the area there's also a speed stance which allows naraco to double wield the sword of matric Combos and lastly there is a power stance where we see the Heavenly sword as it appears in full but naraco's striping enemies with great thoughts switching in and out of each stance on the Fly whilst linking them with combos is essential to overcoming some of the more difficult enemies the game froze your way and luckily you can also counter attack which requires precise timing rewards you with an awesome mini cinematic and Enemy being completely owned by naraco now the learning curve is much deeper than God of War or Dynasty Warriors for example but you get an enormous feeling of satisfaction when you were able to pass the enormous amount of enemy soldiers it's one of the PlayStation 3's first exclusives I am blown away even now how gorgeous this game production plates the character detail in Heavenly sword is amazing and a lot of the game's recognition comes from naroko's awesome red hair that fluid the ABS and floats with every movement you make the environment suggest as impressive as well you'll see gargantuan fortresses Lush Mountain sights and literally hundreds of characters appearing on screen for narrow code to sweep through in some levels there is so much detail that the performance does step a bit but it's never enough to mess up the gameplay all of the locales are Grant and the dynamic camera does a great job of showing off the game's massive style if you've never got around to it back in the day or it is simply fond of hack and slashes there is plenty years about stuck into back in 2004 Sony released siren for the PlayStation 2 a very creepy survival horror game due to its poor sales numbers though we never saw the Super Bowl here in the west and instead we'd have to wait for a remake of the first game hit the PlayStation 3 for another chance to play the game the story sees an American TV crew traveling to Japan to search for hanuda a mysterious Village said to have disappeared after a landslide back into salmon teeth while searching for The Village the crew stumbles across the human sacrifice ritual and after one woman is murdered by its strange participants and otherworldly sirens sound soft and causes blood red rain to fall on the newly reappeared her noodle Village thou trap the American TV crew with a couple of her nudist's remaining residents must survive the Horus and find out the truth behind the sirens Court their blood pierces separated into 12 episodes each with 46 chapters each chapter has your completing a variety of objectives with a certain character that can range from get him to a certain point in the area protecting or obedient secondary character from dangers of finding certain items there are two ways to deal with deadly enemies populating The Village through stealthy infiltrations or through violence combating blockers is much better than the slower mundane system the original with your weapon in hand should now easily hold down one to radiate a new square or R1 to attack visually hanuda Villages excellently designed to look like the haunted desolate hellhole that has become everything from Wide Open Fields streets flooded with red water and a deserted hospital it became a very disturbing intense atmosphere that easily Rivals the likes of Silent Hill the Fatal Frame all in all siren blood piercings quite possibly one of the best horror games on the PlayStation 3. if you're up for a real stare then don't skip this one Battle Gear Solid 4 is without a doubt one of the most notorious games for being stuck on the PlayStation 3. it marks the end of solid's next journey in his fight against the Patriots which sees you traveling with low from the Middle East to South America and even some nostalgic locations for longtime fans throwing it and GS4 built off all of the systems that have come before it in the previous games we still managed to innovate into all its hat it was mainly achieved through the use of octo camosu this new ability streamlined every trip that was introduced in snow theater and allowed you to take on the texture of any object you're in contact with automatically this strip the somewhat cumbersome venue system and allows you to stay in the action which was significantly wrapped up as well instead of solely infiltrating an area and Jasper introduced a battlefield system that saw two factions Engage The Battle as the player you had the choice of a better in its outcome by supporting the local forces and choosing to do so would result in some pretty engaging situations that you wouldn't else find yourself in it's in these moments that the gameplay shine so with the generous amount of weapons to use you'll always find yourself customizing your current setup to suit your approach may that be the stealthy and not lethal path or deciding to act like rapper the gameplay facilitates both now there was no way I wasn't going to mention one of the most impressive aspects of the game and that are the visuals at the time they were nothing short of breath token and managed to still hold up incredibly well to the state and stance is a Real Testament to the power of the PlayStation 3 when it was in the right hand that would be Solid 4 is one hell of a journey and more importantly one knob is worth taking while that does it for today's video keep an eye out for part two as that will be coming up soon so don't forget to

drenar 3 serves the prequel to the first game in the series that released on the PS2 a few years prior and what made those games so notorious was the great art design music an insanely dark story created by Taro Yoko The Narrative is easily the high point and revolves around the internet incredibly powerful goddesses who appeared from nowhere and subjugated the world it seems like they brought peace and order but not every famous as it seems especially since the main character Zero is an interner who wants to kill all the others I don't want to spoil too much so let's just talk about the game play now it's not exactly groundbreaking but it does a far better job than the previous games and allows you to wield up to four different types of weapons you've got your sword which is essentially a jack of all trades your fists which are perfect for dealing with damage on a single enemy lances that make short work of enemy defenses and finally your chck rooms that are perfect for crowd control and ranged attacks you can switch between all of them on the flight making them perfect for the everchanging situations on the battlefield and with them all being able to be upgraded the game constantly deals out new types of attacks and options for you to work into your combos of course like The Originals Your Dragon is also a huge part of the game play but you can't just summon it at will anymore and it's instead confined to certain spots within the game the moment you do get to ride it feel a lot like Panza draon and offer up a nice change of pace from the usual hacken slash gameplay throughout the adventure overall it's clear that dren Guard 3 won't be for everyone but if you're willing to overlook some of the more questionable aspects of the game such as subpar visuals and some of the darker elements of the story then it's well worth giv a go the hype leading up to Killzone 2 was palpable and that no doubt had everything to do with its initial trade that in hindsight was a complete am not of fake to be fair though when the finished product released while it wasn't up to the visual standard of the reveal it soon became one of the best firstperson Shooters on the PlayStation 3 the story involves humans having settled various planets throughout the Galaxy and fighting the invading Hast who are more than ready to stand their ground now once you've completed it it's clear to see that the story is one of the weakest aspects of the game especially when compared to the others in the series but the game play is where kills them too truly excels place like a standard FPS is you shoot aim down your sights throw grenades Crouch and Sprint for cover but there are a few segments that serve to break up the normal gameplay mainly when you jump into one of the many different Vehicles such as tanks that offer a welcome break from the minute to- minute Gunplay the first thing you'll no doubt notice whilst playing the game though are the stunning visuals that take full advantage of the power that the PlayStation 3 offers with the environments looking and feeling incredibly lifelike with plenty of interaction and impressive physics for for example you can tear through walls and pillars making certain buildings collapse or in certain sequences you can blow up Bridges and buildings with an RPG and just watch the beauty of the physics engine as it plays out people doubted that gorilla could match their initial reveal trailer and even though it's clearly not as good they did manage to at least stay true to what they proposed and Killzone 2 raised the bar in terms of visuals and solidified its place as one of the PlayStation 3's defining games blast factor is a top down twin stick shooter and feels a lot like geometry was but with a few ideas of its own that help differentiate it you are a pilot of a G8 Nani Interceptor which is a tiny ship that is injected into infected specimens to destroy viruses there's about seven specimens or stages clear which are all made up of several different screens with your ship and the viruses being confined inside a hexagonal cell that's full of fluid the left stick controls your ship and the right the direction of your shots you've got a few different types such as a basic machine gun a spread fire and homing shots as well as a special weapon known as the Repulsor that allows you to push enemies away from you certain enemies can only be taken out this way and with it having to charge up after every use it's best to save it for when it's absolutely necessary what makes the game play a bit more interesting though is the ability to use the six axis controls motion capabilities and by tilting it from left to right you can tilt the entire cell which creates a wave in the fluid that splashes from one side of the screen to the other this pushes all of the enemies to the edge of the screen and gives you a chance to start fresh should you find yourself being overwhelmed that being said the difficulty curve is finally tuned with the action starting off pretty easy but gradually ramping up to deliver a satisfying level of challenge the inclusion of a multiplayer mode adds even more to the experience allowing you to team up with friends and Co-op or compete against each other to see who can clear levels faster and more efficiently with its combination tie controls simple but stunning visuals and clever gameplay mechanics blast factor is one of the most enjoyable twin stick Shooters on the PlayStation 3 out of all of the games that is stuck on the PlayStation 3 the Motor Storm Series has to be one of the most requested to make a comeback on Modern consoles and it's easy to see why is it's made up of some of the best racing games available on the system now for me it's still the first game that I enjoy the most and like other races it's made out of several different modes with the single player campaign being the main draw here you've got to take on a series of just over 20 events with up to four races making up each of them now the tracks in motor Stone play a large part in the success of the game you'll never follow the same path twice is this just so many ways to complete each race and every course is basically an open-ended level with multiple paths to the Finish Line complimenting this aspect of the game is the huge selection of different Vehicles you get to use from date and quad bikes to trucks and r R cars there's a lot to try out and thankfully the controls are perfect with the different types of terrain and the style of vehicle you're driving affecting how they handle something they all share in common though is the Boost mechanic and you can use it all you want but if the meter goes all the way to the red your engine overheats and your vehicle explodes now even all of these years later when it comes to visuals Motor Storm holds up surprisingly well and looks absolutely gorgeous in motion the lighting and particle effects really stand out with dust clouds mud splashes and sparks flying as Vehicles Collide and Corine across the rugged terrain the attention to detail in the vehicles is truly impressive as well as every scratch dent and mud splatter is meticulously rendered making crashes and collisions feel visceral and impactful whether you're plunging down a muddy slope in a big rig weaving through narrow paths on a dir bike or tearing through the desert in a rad Car Motor Storm delivers in Spades macros 30 is a celebration of the Beloved franchise and brings together characters mechs and music from across its storied history into an incredible action RPG Adventure unfortunately it never made its way west but for non-japanese speakers it's easy to jump into and figure out what to do making it one of the best games for fans of the source material to experience now you take on the role of a pilot known as Leon who becomes stranded on a remote planet where he finds he is far from alone as many others from across time and space have been stranded Ed on the planet as well so it's up to you and these survivors to explore and unlock the secrets of the ruins that cover the world when it comes to gamep playay the previous entries in the series were mostly Mission based but macros 30 Prides itself on being a flight action RPG to start with the world is a series of several large sandbox areas full of enemies cities and missions to complete and instead of unlocking new planes based on a grade or score you now Loop the racks of your enemies for parts and once you find the blueprint for one of you can use them to build yourself a better ma what helps the game succeed is the variety of objectives to complete and apart from the main story there's a ton of side activities to enjoy may that be one of the optional boss battles collection missions and dungeons or several races and timed obstacle courses to get through there's just an insane amount of content that the game Cooks up and while none of them really live up to the main missions they still give you plenty to do while Gathering parts for your next plane overall it's clear to see that macros f is a love letter to the long run INF franchise and is something that's worth playing for Mac fans and especially those of you that enjoy Macross Tokyo Jungle has to be one of the most bizarre games that ever released for the Playstation 3 where you play as one of many different animals and have to survive in a post-apocalyptic Tokyo to see how many years your bloodline can survive this involves getting food avoiding predators and meting to continue on to the next Generation with the gamepl very varing depending on which animal you're playing as as a predator you've got to hunt for other animals and need meat to survive this sees you stalking your prey and hiding in nearby grass and waiting for the right moment to pounce you can either deliver a quick kill shot or run circles around some of the larger beasts and other Predators on the other hand there's moments where you'll be playing as a herbivore and here you'll have to find plants to eat and avoid getting attacked by Predators as you hunt your prey or eat your plants your food in the area will dwindle causing continue to migrate across the map in search of food which keeps the game interesting is there's so many different locations to discover and with the constant looming a threat of death the game never feels slow as you work towards passing on your genes to the Next Generation what's also pretty cool is the game can be played with two players of course this does complicate things as now you have two animals that require food and mating but with the right animals paired and the right teammate you can make a very strong and productive team overall there's not really anything else like it and it's this originality that helps Tokyo Jungle stand out and even though it won't be to everyone's taste if you're looking for something that's truly unique it's definitely worth tracking down the PlayStation 3 was home to many of the best firstperson Shooters of the generation and the third game in the resistance series would see you carrying on the fight against the invading Chimera in one last itch effort to save the world and Humanity as a whole you play as Joe and after the events of the second game that saw the demise of the series former hero it's down to you to finish why he started and everything in the game just screams bigger and better there's larger set pieces huge battles and an ever increasing amount of inventive Weaponry that you get to play with there are 12 weapons in the game and each one feels unique and fun in its own way you can carry all of them at any given time thanks to the fact that Insomniac eliminated the irritating two weapon system from Resistance 2 so you'll never really run out of new ways to rain death on the Chimera the game also benefits from a slick persistent weapon upgrade system that can really help extend your time with the relatively short story mode causing damage with a weapon fills up what amounts to a level up meter and when the meter is full the weapon will automatically upgrade itself then and there on the battlefield these upgrades can be as simple as attachment scope or increasing damage but there is some really cool enhancements such as the ability to fire flaming buck shot from your shotgun overall resistance free is a test to Insomniac game's ability to craft a rich compelling World filled with memorable characters and pulse pounding action so if you've yet to experience it now would be the perfect time to dive into one of the most exhilarating and Unforgettable firstperson Shooters on the PlayStation 3 Initial D extreme stage is based on an anime of the same name and Faithfully recreates the world of its source material featuring various mountain passes and cars that have become synonymous with the franchise you step into the shoes of Tumi and other iconic races as you battle it out on the narrow winding roads of Japan's most demanding tracks at its core it's a game about mastering the art of drift racing and shares a lot of similarities with the likes of Ridge Racer with offering a much more arcadey approach to its gameplay instead of the realism you'll find in simulators like Gran Turismo the game is made up of two main modes you've got time attack and the legend mode with the latter delivering the bulk of what the game has to offer it split up into a range of different races or battles that see you being rewarded with points upon their completion you can use these points to upgrade your car's performance and appearance in the garage which all have a noticeable effect out on the road now the controls are quite slippery and it'll take some time to get used to the handling of each car but if you stick with it you'll be nailing Each corner in no time but the game does require a lot of grinding to get to the higher levels and defeat some of the more difficult Rivals which sees you having to repeat most of the stages but with the fun and exhilarating gameplay it never once feels like a chore and with the amount of unlockable content you'll always feel like you're being rewarded while it may not cater to Casual players due to its challenging gameplay fans of the series and racing enthusiasts will find much to love so whether you're a Die Hard Initial D fan or someone just looking for a unique and rewarding racing game Extreme stage is a must have title for the PS3 Genji will likely only ever be remembered for its Infamous reveal at E3 but despite all of the memes it's actually a pretty decent game and followup to the original on the PS2 set 3 years after the events of the first game the story throws you into the world of ancient Japan with the player taken on the role of Yoshi sun and his allies is they face a new threat from an evil Clan who have returned with a powerful Army bolstered by mystical forces now you get to play as one of four different characters you've got the fast swordsman capable of executing rapid combos a Hulan Warrior who sells a crowd control a skilled Archer that adds ranged attacks into the mix and finally a heavy hitter that incorporates magic into their fighting style as you will guess each of their strengths and abilities is suited to different situations and being able to switch between them on the flight makes the combat feel strategic and satisfying with you being able to chain combos execute powerful finishing moves and utilize special abilities to turn the ti of battle there's also several RPG aspects in the game which see you being able to upgrade your health and weapons by acquiring different types of essence throughout the adventure these are usually earned by defeating certain enemies or exploring one of the many locations you visit throughout the game giving you an incentive to not just simply rush through all of the levels as fast as you can while it may not have reached the widespread ACC claim of other games on the PlayStation 3 there's no denying that it captures the spirit of the Samurai epic that clearly inspired it so for fans of action games or just Japanese culture in general definitely worth tracking down Tales of exilia 2 picks up a year after the events of the first game and begins with the main character ludar whose life takes a dramatic turn when he's drawn into a conflict involving alternative dimensions and a mysterious organization alongside returning characters from the first game you embark on a journey to save the world while grappling with your own destiny and while the story may be a bit convoluted it does a good job of keeping the action flowing now the Hallmark of the tale series is its action-packed linear motion battel system and tales of exidia 2 refines this formula to near Perfection the combat is fast fluid and deeply satisfying offering a mix of realtime action and strategy with looka having the ability to switch between three different types of weapons you've got dual swords guns and a sledgehammer that all have a role to play depending on the enemy in your sights as you would expect each of them come with their own special moves or Arts as the game refers to them which makes short work if the enemies were used correctly and complimenting this is the return of link system from the face game that enables you to team up with your party members and deliver powerful attacks that contain the flow of combat and the blink of a night now one area where the game excels is within its replay value is throughout the game you have to make decisions in the story which alter its path and unlock one of the game's five different endings that may claim through it again all the more worthwhile whether you're a season fan of the series or a newcomer its combination of emotional depth thrilling battles and player driven story talent make it one of the most memorable entries in the series and one of the best RPGs on the PlayStation 3 well that does it for today's video keep an eye out for part three is Lev will be coming up

welcome to the show today we are talking about 10 must have games for the PlayStation 3 nuni combines the talent of level five in studio gibli to create one of the most interesting jrpgs to date the story revolves around a boy called Oliver who enters another world with his Welsh fairy companion Mr drippy the worlds are connected so if Oliver does not save the day both worlds will perish now the game play is mostly standard jrpg Fair which sees you meeting some interesting characters visiting an array of locations and resolving a variety of different problems now when you combine this with the added inclusion of Pokémon style Monster hunting you were sure to be kept busy for quite some time visually there's not much to be said the game looks just like an animated film and with the handdrawn Cuts scenes being provided by Studio GI everything appears beautiful the musical score perfectly complements the game and helps Elevate the story's more spectacular moments there are some aspects of the game that will test your patience and irritate you but nuni is a visually stunning game and provides one of the best jrpg experiences available for the PS3 how far will you go to save someone you love this is the manro that permeates throughout heavy range duration and offens up some of Gaming's truly emotional or moments that should not be missed Heavy Rain Is a lot like Marmite you either love it or hate it it's a very polarizing game and more of an interactive film of sorts if you're familiar with the previous work of Quantic dreams such as Fahrenheit you'll know exactly what to expect the action unfolds through the use of various QuickTime events as well as sections that see you exploring and investigating the various areas that comprise the adventure in an industry that is drowning and endless Shooters and over-the-top [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] a game like heavy rain is a breath of fresh air with a few twists in turns along the way Heavy Rain manages to deliver a gripping story that admittedly at times can be a bit jarring due to some minor plot holes but with a man like David cage of the helm what do you expect this game is not for everyone and I'll be the first one to admit that the controls will make you want to bang your head against the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] wall and that's some of the voice acting borderlines hilarity but it's hard to dismiss the game on a few floors due to the huge amount that it gets right the atmosphere and tone of the narrative was something that truly gripped me and I believe that it should be experienced by everyone you're probably getting sick and tired of Ridge Racer appearing on these lists but I can't help it I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] love the series Bridge racer 7 is no exception offering a huge array of vehicles and tracks as well as a robust online mode which is surprisingly still active to this day you'll be hard pressed to find a more enjoyable arcade racing experience for the Playstation 3 I fully acknowledge the likes of Gran Turismo and especially Burnout Paradise but there is just something about rid racer that keeps me coming back time and time again maybe it's the over-the-top music it could even be the enthusiastic manner of the announcers that comment on your every move as you slip and slide around each track if you're looking for a fun pickup and play Arcade racer Ridge Racer 7 has got you covered and with the amount of content included it's bound to keep you playing for a long time Frankish is a third person cover based shooter developed by Platinum Games and published by Sega brought To Us by Shinji makami The Mastermind behind the Resident Evil series the game my opinion is nothing short of fantastic let's get this out of the way the story is completely uninspired and won't be winning any awards but that is not what Vanquish is about it's all about the game play and on that level Vanquish truly succeeds the combat is fast and intense which sees you boosting around the environment whilst dodging attacks and taking down bosses the size of Godzilla now the game is not that long and will be completed within about 4 to 5 hours but with the nature of the game play you will find yourself coming back basically if you want to feel like a badass this is the game for you it oo's style and confidence and is definitely one of those games that deserves a look Demon Souls was made to ruin your life to make you question your worth as a human being and ultimately to test the very Fringe of your patience all joking aside though this game is not for everyone you will die a lot there is no question of that but what makes demon so special is the way in which it encourages you to get better to pick up the controller again and to figure out where you went wrong it is insanely difficult but not to the point where it's unfair the game requires you to trade blows with your enemy manually Dodge block and Parry attacks while waiting for a clear opening before attacking it requires you to observe your enemy's movements rather than just rushing in and smashing buttons you are going to suffer a lot in this game begging the monsters to give you a break while you roll away trying to reach safety you'll curse and throw your controller at the screen but once you beat the game all your suffering and despair will be lifted this game provides a true sense of accomplishment to those who are willing to take the time to be patient with the controls and aspects that make up the nightmare honestly it took me a while to get into this game but once everything clicks you'll find one of the PlayStation 3's best games the most intriguing aspect of joury has to be how the entire Adventure is open for interpretation the game never specifically spells things out and encourages the player to make up their own mind about the events that take place Journey places you in a beautiful world with the ambiguous character the environment and the goal create an Ambiance that lifts the qu theme to a climax throughout the whole game everything from the music being on Queue to the silence itself helps raise journey to a totally different level which brings me to jour's Unique way of handling multiplayer there are no menus no chat if you happen to come across another player your only way to communicate is by hitting a button that sends out a note of Music this aspect of the game lend itself so nicely to the overall feeling of the experience and goes a long way in immersing yourself in the world it's an Arty game but one that I think everyone should try Journey's minimalist concept simple gameplay beautiful visuals and tranquil soundtrack create an experience unlike any other admittedly it is a bit short and only lasts about 2 hours but it was an adventure that I'll never forget a nostalgic return to two of the greatest games ever made the Eco and Shadow of the classes collection is definitely something you should check out admittedly it won't be everyone's cup of tea but the amount on offer here is something that should not be passed up the improved presentation of the games help introduce Eco and Colossus to a new new generation of Gamers while retaining all of the magic experienced during their original releases cleaner crisper visuals and thankfully a frame rate that doesn't gouge your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] eyes out a ro present and contribute to the overall game elevating it beyond the PS2 Originals Eco is about a young boy who must escape a Strange Land from a mysterious girl who is held captive by shadowy creatures you must work together to solve puzzles Escape enemies and traps and ultimately win your freedom now Colossus has always been my favorite of the two and whilst the game keeps the athetic qualities of EO in place it possesses vastly different gameplay for a start it's an open World sandbox adventure and your main task is to destroy huge giants known as colossi each one possesses their own unique attributes and half of the battle is devising strategies that will ultimately result in a defeat these games are truly epic in every sense of the word you owe it to yourself to try them out Uncharted 2 is without a doubt one of the best games I've played on the PS3 the single player campaign is absolutely fantastic the game feels very much like a great adventure movie with likable characters who try to survive various hectic situations in beautiful parts of the world everything about this game screams quality gorgeous Graphics convincing voiceover an intense although not revolutionary gameplay Uncharted 2 is one of those games that I could not stop playing and was constantly intrigued about what would be happening next this game fixed a few problems that were present in the face outting the mechanics and puzzles all feel Superior there's a wider variet of guns and the overall experience is more complete when compared to Drake's Fortune achieving Perfection may be impossible but Uncharted 2 has one hell of a go if you own a PlayStation 3 you have to buy this game it's truly a must have for the system and in my opinion the better out of the free available for the Playstation 3 the amount of hype leading up to metal the solid 4's release was unprecedented I mean here we had a game with the weight of three critically acclaimed prequels on his shoulders promising to give us closure on a story spanning more than 20 years okay that closure came in the form of nanom machines but it was closure nonetheless Metal Gear Solid force or a departure from the more Japanese Centric game design of the series past and embraced a more Western approach to its gameplay and features including over the shoulder aiming and weapon customization that was received well amongst fans now MJS 4 does have its faults as mentioned there were some serious low points in the story that end up feeling like a bit of a cop out for veteran fans of the series but we can hardly be surprised when it is well known that kajima never even wanted to make this game nevertheless if you enjoy Metal Gear number four will take all of the boxes and offer you a definitive end to the story of Solid Snake nauy dog's interpretation of the popular zombie outbreak theme that seems to have infected every aspect of gaming and movies is truly special where others have failed this is where Naughty Dog succeeds the first thing that will grip you when playing the game is how real Everything feels as with most of the studi games the amount of detail present within the world is outstanding and manages to draw the player into a rich and emotional Adventure that sees you traveling across America to unravel a mysterious viral outbreak and the key to its defeat when the game took the stage at E3 in 2012 it blew everyone away with this intense gameplay in combat as well as introducing us to the various mechanics that make up the game such as the crafting system that sees you creating half of the weapons that you will use throughout the adventure The Last of Us truly feels like the PlayStation 3 swansong and if you fancy picking it up for the console the game was kindly remastered for the PS4 which is the best version to get well that was it guys I want to thank you for taking the time to check this video out if you enjoyed it why not subscribe to the show so you can stay up to date with everything that we're doing as always I'll see you next time

near is a pure action RPG in every sense of the word that's set in a post-apocalyptic world where a father is fighting to save his daughter from a mysterious disease known as the black scroll ni story is dark unpredictable and isn't afraid to hit you where it hurts with several mature themes and Concepts that help Propel it into one of the most memorable games you'll find on the PlayStation 3 when it comes to gameplay you wield a variety of weapons such as single-handed swords axes and Spears coupled with an array of very powerful visually stunning magic spells which can be used to annihilate the vast hordes of enemies that come your way as with most action RPGs you've got access to the typical host of abilities such as jumping dodging blocking and Powerful special attacks which is bolstered by the huge number of weapons to collect and get into grips with the unique qualities of each is essential to carve a path forward furthermore it's the delicate balance of juggling your melee attacks with your magic skills that truly form the basis of the combat system and once you've got it down you'll feel nonon Unstoppable now what helps differentiate Nea from its contemporaries is the way in which customization and leveling up is handled in the game you don't have traditional St points to distribute but you can customize your spells and your weapons in several ways by using money and special items known as words adding these items to a weapon will increase its damage or defensive qualities allowing you to cater each option you have to your liking and play start simply put neara is one of the best games that I have ever played it blows many other games out of the water in terms of story has some solid and varied gameplay and is an unforgettable if sad Journey if that sounds like something you're interested in then don't hesitate picking this one up Star Ocean is one of the longest running series when it comes to to RPGs with its routs reaching back all the way to the Super Nintendo for those unfamiliar with the franchise it all takes place in a universe that's very similar to the likes of Star Trek but the last hope is a prequel to the other three star oan titles and it takes place long before any of those exist the story opens of the dawn of human space exploration and the protagonist Edge Maverick is one of the first humans to travel aboard a faster than light Starship as you leave Earth wholly ignorant of the great Universe on a mission of Discovery when it comes to the game play it's very clear that a lot of love and attention went into the battle system and it really shows the system will be familiar to anyone who has played a previous star oan or any action RPGs such as the tail series characters and enemies act in real time performing attack combos Magic and movement commands and each of them has his or her own unique set of skills that can be freely switched between at any time allowing you to take advantage of everything they all bring to the table whether you prefer to be up in the thick of it slinging arrows or spells or even a mix of the two there will be a character to suit your play style in the end what we have here is an extremely enjoyable action RPG that goes well above many of the other games available on the PlayStation 3 the balance of action the systems in play and an enjoyable story to play through make it one of the best entries in the series with it now being available on Modern consoles with an updated look and several positive changes to few of the negative aspects of the game there's never been a better time than now to jump into one of the most enjoyable star oan games out there the taale series is by far one of my favorite RPG franchises and when it comes to the PlayStation 3 exilia 2 has to be the best of the bunch it picks up after the events of the first game and frows you into the shoes of ler as you descend into a world full of shady corporations and terrorists that are out to fulfill their evil schemes on the gameplay front if you've ever played a Tales game before you'll know exactly what to expect as it sees you traveling from from town to town through fields and dungeons upgrading your equipment with new pieces and learning a wide variety of arts and skills for battle the game is divided into about 16 main chapters and you have several character Quests for each of your party members which Pats off the adventure in meaningful ways as well as many jobs and side quests that you can take on to earn money for special or rare items of course the real meat and potatoes is within combat and this is where exilia 2 much like many of the previous Tales games shine it all plays out out in real time it allows you to perform a string of basic attacks that form combos but what helps it Excel however is the inclusion of special skills or Arts that bring about a real sense of strategy to reach encounter while the minute to- minute battles aren't exactly tricky to win it's the boss fights that see the combat system come alive and this is where something known as the weakness system comes into play if you use elements that the enemy is weak against to attack you can easily start a huge combo and the more physical the Magical elements you throw into that combo the longer it will last and the higher the damage multiplier will be so using it to your advantage is essential if you hope to make it to the end with its gripping combat intriguing narrative and slamming soundtrack Tales of exidia 2 is a great action RPG to jump into especially for longtime fans of the series 3d. Game Heroes is a highly unique action RPG that shares a striking resemblance with the early Zelda games you take on the role of the hero as you're tasked with Lo ating and securing several powerful orbs that have the ability to seal away a great evil that after hundreds of years has escaped its captivity and started wreaking havoc on the Kingdom on your journey you will explore six temples with themes Loosely based on the surrounding terrain and much like Zelda each Temple will bestow the player with a new item such as a boomerang hook shot bombs and a magic one that shoots fire this simple setup slowly deals out new ways to approach the ever increasing number of enemies that wonder the land and the several bosses that that occupy each Temple you visit at this point it all sounds like a carbon copy of Zelda so what helps this stand out against this clear inspiration first off is the humor this is a very silly game that never takes itself seriously and it's difficult not to have even a few cheap laughs at the awkward lines of dialogue you'll see secondly is the ability to upgrade your sword and there's a few of them to collect from your standard wooden sword to one resembling Excalibur and even a giant fish you get to swing around by visiting one of the many blacksmiths that litter the king them you can upgrade your swords length width strength and much more allowing you to develop your hero into a sizable threat visually everything in the game is blocky and pixelated though entirely 3D admittedly a few characters and monsters are hard to make out but it all works well for the game you won't be blown away by the graphics but they are certainly appealing in their own creative and unique way if you're fond of the action RPGs of all then 3d. Game Heroes Cooks up the perfect mix of both old and new creating what is likely one of the best examp examples of the genre on the PlayStation 3 originally planned to be an MMO Kingdoms of Amalur would eventually be remodeled as a single player action RPG that allows you to create your own character from scratch and set off in the hopes of bringing an end to a nonon endless war between two Waring factions as the main plot progresses your puzzling past is slowly and cleverly unveiled through a nicely paced Journey that's packed full of twists and turns that'll keep you guessing now once you've created your character you're free to roam the kingdom and take on a series of quests that have a nice amount of variety to them as well as tackle a range of dungeons that'll test your understanding of the mechanics to the Limit as with most RPGs there's a huge emphasis on classes that's so you're getting to choose from might finesse and sorcery these are the same as fighter Rogue and Mage classes you may encounter in other games with each of them coming with their own skill tree to develop there's an insane amount of different skills to learn which makes combat a true highlight of the experience and relies upon the strategic use of your basic attacks as you mix them with the far more devastating skills at your disposal and what bolsters this aspect of the game play is the customization that's afforded to the player one great thing about this system is the fact that you don't have to think too hard about what you want to invest in cuz you can completely wipe your slate clean and put your points into a different skill this allows you to experiment with the enormous amount of options and eventually settle on what suits you the best simply part kingdoms of amalar is an amazing game with great customization gameplay and a huge World waiting to be explored so if you're looking to undertake a new adventure this offers up a solid option to consider first release in way back in 2008 on the PlayStation 2 Odin spear is a remas port that the developers claim is supposed to represent its original vision for the game it all centers around the constant war between various factions of the world of Arion who are vying for the power left behind by an enigmatic Kingdom which mysteriously disappeared overnight you get to choose from Five Characters each representing these different parties and make your way through various stages that mix elements of both beat maps and RPGs to create something truly special all of the action takes place from a sidescrolling perspective and sees each of the characters you get to use all possessing their own unique traits and moves to get the job done moment to moment you'll be stringing together slashes aerial juggles slide kicks and so forth until the screen is absolutely filled with flames and hit points and can become absolute Mayhem but thanks to the visceral depiction of the combat every hit you make packs a real punch by adding spells into the mix you can further disrupt the Enemy by spawning a volcano onto the battlefield or enclosing the region in a poisonous Cloud these special abilities carve out several ways for the player to approach each situation and as you progress more and more of them become available to use so they are perfect to experiment with and slowly settle into a Groove now when talking about Odin spere there is one aspect that you simply cannot ignore and that is the visuals the Sprite work is simply jaw dropping with plenty of different animations that bring each character to life but just as impressive as that of the stages themselves which blend in perfectly with the action and give the game a somewhat paint in come to life athetic that looks incredible in motion overall this is one action RPG you do not want to skip Dragon's Dogma is often compared to the likes of Skyrim with the intricate combat of the Dark Souls series as it manages to bring together many different ideas to create something completely unique that many fans of the genre will enjoy you take up the fight is the Arisen a hero of Legend who is said to have come into contact with a dragon and had his heart stolen somehow you survive the encounter and now you have to track it down and reclaim what is yours to be fair the story isn't exactly anything groundbreaking and only really picks up towards the end of the game but this in no way detracts from the game playay and this is where Dragon's Dogma comes into its own combat is a generous mix of traditional real-time action and management of abilities and after an extensive character creation process at the start of the game you'll be forced to pick from one of three classes Strider major and fighter each class or vocation offers a unique set of skills and play styles that is most definitely going to suit anyone's approach but combat is more than just hitting something with a sword or firing an arrow and revolves around using a grappling hook to tackle Larger than Life enemies it's a lot like Shadow of the Colossus with all of the classes being able to grab onto a creature and scale it to attack specific weak spots but obviously some are better at it than others favor enhancing the combat is the concept of Pawns a Pawn's Effectiveness is mainly determined by how well their creator sets them up and there are several key factors involved in determining their effectiveness like stats level special abilities and Equipment utilizing these Pawns in your party is essential for tackling some of the more powerful enemies that roam the world and easily becomes one of the game most intriguing aspects though not without a few technical flaws Dragon's Dogma is a brilliant game that will manage to Captivate and infall anyone willing to put the timing Dragon Age Inquisition was a game that had a lot riding on it especially after the various missteps with the previous games in the series many were hoping that it would be a return to form following a somewhat troubling development period due to the at the time new frostbite engine Inquisition managed to deliver not only with a great story and characters but several new gameplay mechanics that enhance the experience following a series of mysterious Rifts opening up around the world it's down to you and your unique talent to close them that sets off an adventure across two massive continents absolutely brimming with quests to undertake and plenty of secrets to find now the fighting system is fairly fluid and enjoyable combining the greatest elements of Dragon Age Origins and Dragon Age 2 it brings back the Tactical view which adds even more strategies combat and allows players to pause at any time during a battle and move about the battlefield to give orders or see how various opponents or party members are doing along with all the coverage and command that Dragon Age Origins offered on the PC this makes combat the most engaging part of the experience with the amount of skills and ways to advance your character is easily the most rewarding as well although the game isn't perfect which is mainly due to its visual makeup not exactly hitting the mark and especially the frame rate which at times can chug along once the action on screen abser it's nothing that completely ruins the game and with it also being available on the PS4 with many of these issues I in doubt is still a compelling Adventure regardless of the console you decide to play it on folklore is without a doubt one of the most underrated action RPGs of all time it puts you into the shoes of Keats and Ellen as they visit a mysterious Village known as Dulin that is rumored to how a way to travel between the worlds of the living and the dead now the narrative is by far one of the most intriguing aspects of the game so I don't want to go into it too much and instead I'll leave that up to your own Discovery thankfully the game play is just as compelling which sees you during the daylight hours moving your character around the desolate Village of Dulin and talking with the various Shady inhabitants to unravel the mysteries of the never World during the night time you get to travel to this space and in this realm you must battle against creatures known as folks with the goal being to defeat them and then use their unique abilities in battle for yourself they mainly serve as a means to protect yourself in battle which all plays out in real time with each of them being assigned to one of the face buttons there's at least 100 of these Critters to collect each with their own unique traits and advantages and the combinations you can come up with are almost endless which helps keep combat from ever feeling repetitive whilst it's not one of the best looking games on the PlayStation 3 folklore is by far one of the most artistic and imaginative games you'll find on the system the various Realms that make up the adventure are highly impressive from the Lush Greenery of the fairy realm to the burn out War torn cities of War Cadia there's a serious amount of creativity in each of their designs that lends the game a real sense of wonder as you make your way through it to the end overall if there was one game you should definitely take the time to experience on this list then folklore is a no-brainer with its incredible story and compelling gameplay mechanics it will not disappoint demon sources set in the world of balleria a large land of endless natural beauty and impressive landmarks after its king performs a dark ritual to harness the power of souls a brief Golden Age descends upon the kingdom but it's not long until an ancient evil is awakened because of it and a fog brings in Soul devouring demons that start to feed on the land's inhabitants though the World building is very extensive the story's involvement in the game is actually quite slim and instead the main focus is on what Demon Souls get so right and that's the game play at its core the game is a typical hacken SL RPG where the goal is to slay large enemies to finish each level however it's not as simple as that when you start to look closer when you start the game and get through the Character Creator you can choose a special class this will determine what equipment you are given at the start along with your base stats from there you are pretty much free to progress as you wish you can focus on Magic brute strength for Speed or ranged attacks and the variety of weapons spells armor and other equipment is absolutely staggering the soul system is another factor of the game that provides a difficulty boost souls are both the currency and experience part point of the game all things are bought with demon souls and leveling up various stats also requires them now difficulty is a huge part of demon souls and there's no beating around the bush this game is going to kick your ass but it never once feels like the fault of the game itself but rather a lack of skill on behalf the player this constant need to improve is what underpins the entire experience and once you've got it down slaying each demon is something that just never gets old if you never got around to this one back on the Playstation 3 there's now a full remake for the PS5 if you're lucky to W that console well that does it for today's video keep an eye out for part two

lollipop chainsaw continued the trend of arcadey replayable experiences led by famed developer suda 51 have become so well known for the game from start to finish is a familiar low budget grindhouse experience which is high on style and low on complexity you take up the role of juliet a bubbly cheerleader with blonde pigtails who just so happens to be a descendant of a long line of zombie hunters her weapon of choice is a sparkling rainbow spearing chainsaw and it all sounds completely ridiculous and that's because it is from the first moment the game is blaring warnings that it is not to be taken seriously as a narrative the story manages to keep up a solid pace with several cartoons book aimed in each of the seven total stages which all continually updo its own insanity with each passing second now combat is largely relegated to simple button presses with few defensive options and the game doesn't really reward you for mixing it up so finding a couple of combos that work for you can carry you right up until the end credits it now goes for about 65 on the ps3 and although the game is nothing groundbreaking the clear level of charm that lollipop chainsaw possesses is one of its best aspects that is bound to keep players coming back time and time again el shaddai is a simple hack and slash and also a full-on platformer in fact the game is clearly divided equally between these two types of gameplay your journey takes you through the various floors of a tower that the angels who are track and down created you fight smaller demons on the way to each angel which serves as the boss of each floor the closest reference to the feel of the combat is the original dmc but a more stripped down and minimal vision there's only really two buttons that you use to fight one being a mid-air attack and the other a special move that is either defensive or evasive in nature now the combat could be considered but matchy but thanks to the inclusion of several abilities known as god's weapons a bit more strategy is afforded to the gameplay there are three weapons in total a heavy shield like smashing weapon that is slow but strong on the fence and defense a lightsaber type sword that is both quite fast and fairly strong and a strange long-range shooting weapon that is quite hard to describe but it's fast and allows the player to dash around switching between them on the fly provides a means to outsmart your enemy and soon becomes one of the most engaging aspects of the game if you're lucky you'll be able to find also dive for around 80 dollars these days with that number slowly rising as more and more people realize just how incredible this game is taking place in the fictional realm of dotner it's the player's role as the hero to rid the land of a great evil which is responsible for casting a devastating plague upon its citizens at the beginning of the adventure the game presents you with a generous amount of options to create your own character to follow you on your journey the gameplay shares many similarities with the role-playing games of all such as the early zeldas and dragon quest titles it all revolves around exploring the world and the many dungeons that are part of it as you utilize various items such as lanterns bows and boomerangs to overcome the range of enemies as well as some truly head scratching puzzles one of the main aspects of the game is the combat which sees the size of your sword continually growing once being swung it makes taking out enemies all the more easier and on top of this the sword can be fully customized and upgraded throughout the course of the adventure if you missed out on this one when it first released it now goes for around 75 splatterhouse originally released for the arcades in 1988 and saw a selection of ports to various consoles and devices over the years it wasn't until 2010 that the ip was resurrected and introduced by namco naturally it's a stark difference between both versions but the latest incarnation retains the spirit of the original and presents a combat center of take on the concept you take up the fight as rick and engage in either hand-to-hand combat or with a wide range of makeshift weapons that makes taking on the hordes of enemies and absolute breeds the main goal of the combat is to link attacks together to perform combos and collect the blood that is dropped by the enemies the more you collect the more moves and special attacks you can unlock it provides a nice sense of progression which keeps each battle from becoming stale due to a constant string of new abilities coming your way the most devastating being the splatter which finishes off enemies in a variety of gory ways but it's not only the combat that makes up the gameplay several platforming elements and puzzles are part of the natural progression of each level and split up the action nicely sometimes these quiet moments can provide some much needed downtime especially after some of the insane fights you'll find yourself getting into the game now goes for about 80 if you can find a copy which is complete folklore is essentially an action rpg that all revolves around two main protagonists and takes place in the present day after the two main characters experienced separate events that compel them to visit a mysterious village in ireland it doesn't take long for them both to realize that everything is not as it seems before they are plunged into a separate reality that lends much inspiration from celtic myths now you have the choice of choosing between the two characters which both have unique journeys and manages to promote subsequent playthroughs once you've finished it mainly in order to see everything the experience has to offer now where folklore truly shines within battle with most of the enemies that you encounter are able to be absorbed upon defeating them it's a pretty unique mechanic and lends the gameplay an extra layer of strategy as only four can be mapped to the face buttons at any one time each enemy usually represents a different element so when you use them to take on your foes switching the right ones in and out to effectively address the situation at hand is the name of the game upon its release folklore didn't manage to find its feet and as a consequence went by largely unnoticed and this no doubt contributed to its now 80 asking price starting out life on the playstation 1 spyro soon became synonymous with the playstation brand and went on to become one of its best sellers the series continued to evolve and iterate up until the final entry in a trilogy known as the dawn of the dragon and once again saw players taking up the role of spyro and cinder as they continued their journey to ultimately bring an end to the dark master the adventure is largely split up into several different locations the see you visiting ancient ruins to lava filled plains and flooded wastelands now the first aspect that many will notice are the incredible visuals especially the effects which manage to light up the screen in style when encountering enemies as spyro you have a range of abilities to help you during these moments from breathing fire to more intricate skills that involve both spyro and cinder working together the minute a of gameplay is engaging and tight it's largely broken up by several platforming sections as well that offer an escalating sense of difficulty as you make your way to the end dawn of the dragon serves as a worthy end to the reboot trilogy and sees spyro going out with a band a physical copy will probably set you back around 85 these days and expect to pay a lot more for a sealed copy the ps3 was home to a wide range of incredible sports games especially when it came to basketball college hoops 2k8 is one of the standout examples whereas most companies used to simply take their nba engine and slap a coat of ncaa paint over it fans of the sport could instantly sense the difference the subtle changes in the rules and setup is what makes college balls so appealing thankfully 2k managed to put together an impressive package that captured the essence of the sport and is quite easily the best in the series the 2k8 edition introduced many new aspects to the franchise the first and most celebrated being the inclusion of a sixth man meter which measured the crowd's enthusiasm by performing well in the game you could boost the meter causing the fans in the stand to go wild this had an effect on your team boosting their confidence and allowing them to play better than they normally do and it also affected the opponents distracting them and causing them to play less effectively it was a really neat conclusion which made college hoops 2k8 one of the most enjoyable sports games on the system it now goes for around 110 and has quickly become one of the most sought after games on the playstation 3.

jojo's all-star battle is a 3d fighter that brings many aspects of the beloved anime to life as you would expect a huge amount of characters make an appearance and all offer their own unique moves and special abilities trying out each is one of the best aspects of the game they all differ in style and general attributes as well from the nimble and fast to the slow and strong half of the fun is making your way through the roster and finding one that suits you best although due to this it does have the potential to seriously mess with the balance of the game it's nothing that completely ruins it though as with most fighters you can expect to see a range of different modes to indulge in from the campaign to versus and online there's a generous amount of options but you'll most likely find yourself spending most of your time in the campaign it introduces some unique rules where players will battle against the customized characters of other players or a boss may appear instead you can also win medals and other prizes for competing well in the mode and characters can be further customized with aesthetic changes that affects how the fighters look in battle visually all-star battle is the most impressive aspect of the experience each character model stage and special ability are lovingly animated which manages to lend a real sense of style to each encounter it now goes for around 120 dollars so finding a copy won't be cheap the playstation 3 managed to introduce many unique games to us one of them being africa that tasks you with becoming a wildlife photographer it seems to take the basic concept of pokemon snap and build upon it in many interesting ways for starters the environments you get to explore are truly impressive whether you're exploring by jeep or on foot they each serve as the home of the varied wildlife you encounter throughout the game from elephants to giraffes and zebras there's a generous amount on offer here now what makes each of the animals stand out the incredible animations when zooming in with your camera you'll be able to spot specific details of each animal that lends each of them a real sense of personality now there's not much in the way of narrative but it does try to add some context to the situation you essentially get to choose between playing a journalist or a zoologist and is sent out to catalog the various animals in the region each photo you take is recorded and then sent away via email at your home base which creates a pretty interesting loop that players will either fully engage with or instantly want nothing to do with it's a really calm and relaxing game which may have the potential to turn some players away but if you're up for it the game now goes for about a hundred and forty dollars which is quite expensive for what's on offer it may be bit of a surprise that one of the most expensive games on the playstation 3 is a sports title a sports title from ea for that matter nba elite 11 was originally scheduled to be released for both the 360 and ps3 for fans of the sport the game was shaping up to be something truly special as this was the first title to debut the new become legendary mode that was going to play a lot like the similar modes you often see in fifa or madden that focuses on player progression when compared to the previous year the controls have been completely overhauled with much of the actions such as shooting or layups now being assigned to the right analog stick the intention was to offer a streamlined a much more easily accessible game but due to the usual ea [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the game never truly saw the light of day the developers were slammed with an 18-month development cycle getting the game up to scratch before its release proved too much of a challenge with glaring bugs and glitches that made the game unplayable at points ea decided to pull the plug and cancel the release but not before some copies managed to find their way out into the wild that's why nba elite 11 can go upwards of 880 on the system it's an absurd amount of money for a game but due to its increased rarity the price is absolutely skyrocketed well that does it for today's video don't forget to hit subscribe and follow me on all of the socials to stay up to date on future videos and to take part in giveaways you can also join our growing community on discord and meet many like-minded gamers to continue the conversation with i'd like to give a special shout out to our patreon supporters rhino skill gym nano steve and paddy j for their continued support that helps make these videos possible if you're interested in joining our discord or supporting the channel through patreon you'll find the links in the description as always thanks for taking the time to watch the video i'll catch you next time you

Dark Void is one of those games that jumped on the third person bandwagon after the huge success of Gears of War and while it does have some decent ideas that it brings to the table it unfortunately never hit the ground running and ended up falling Into Obscurity you take on the role of will gray a car pilot who crash lands into a mysterious world where survivors from across history are in a constant battle with robots known as the Watchers who want nothing more than to see Humanity suffer it's a pretty intriguing sci-fi premise and with the talent of the likes of Nolan North the story is delivered surprisingly well which edges into bovie territory at times thanks to the somewhat cheesy dialogue but with plenty of twists and turns to keep you guessing it ends up being one of the better aspects of the game now gameplay is a mix of third person coverb shooting an aerial combat thanks to your jetpack which plays a major role in the action it lets you blast off from the ground H midair or rock it through the sky and brings a different Edge to each fight as well as exploring one of the many different environments throughout the game weapons wise you've got the standard mix of human Firearms like pistols and machine guns but also get more exotic options in the form of the alien Tech like plasma cannons and emps that help mix up the otherwise basic shooting it's not perfect though and several technical issues hold it back from greatness with awkward cover Transitions and a somewhat floaty feeling to the game's weapons but it's nothing that completely ruins the experience and what you're left with is one of the best hidden gems on the PlayStation 3 that never managed to soore to the same Heights of the games that clearly inspired him there were plenty of incredible action RPGs on the PlayStation 3 but one that seemingly fell through the cracks his Bound By Flame which set out to mix a gritty story with intense com combat and a focus on player choice which sadly went missed by many you take on the role of Vulcan a mercenary possessed by a demon who struggles with its influence throughout the game you can either resist its power and cling to your Humanity or trade your soul for Supernatural might it all unfolds throughout the campaign and while it's not exactly a sprawling epic it does a good job of delivering a tight narrative clocking in its seven chapters that see you visiting all kinds of unique locations and meeting characters that develop the story in different ways on the gameplay front combat is while steals the show and sees you toggling between two different stances one being the fighter that's a slow heavy hitting style with a two-handed sword and the ranger a far more Nimble approach that relies on dual daggers for quicker strikes the demon style adds a third option which is essentially your magic and allows you to he Fireballs or perform one of the many different AOE attacks that can flip the tables in a Flash switching between all three of them and utilizing them effectively depending on the enemy at hand is at the core of the game gameplay Loop and while it's not as polished as the likes of Dark Souls the variety and difficulty of each fight deliver a satisfying sense of reward which mainly comes in the form of leveling up and here you get to alter your character's growth with a few different skill trees that make Replay in the game all the more enjoyable to see each and every ability you can unlock even though it's smaller budget clearly shows Bound By Flames still offers a compelling action RPG to make your way through so if you see it for cheap it's definitely worth adding to your collection Arana heart 3 is a 2d fighter that offers a refreshing twist to the genre with a vibrant cast of characters that blend anime inspired fare with in-depth mechanics that are bound to Intrigue both casual and hardcore players alike the story revolves around a group of women who wield Supernatural powers where the Skies over Japan have split open due to a dimensional Rift and it's up to them to team up with Celestial beings known as Arana to stop those responsible the story is delivered through visual novel styled cutcenes and filled with about every Trope that you can imagine but the fighting is the real draw and here is where the game truly hits it strip built on a four button setup light medium heavy and Arcana attacks it's easy to jump in with basic chains and specials but mastering the mechanics will take some time and dedication and for those that want to there's a lot to digest first off the Arcana system which sees each of the characters pair in with one of several Elemental spirits that Grant you different Buffs special mov moves and supers that dramatically alter the play style of the fighter for example you can pair a thunder Arcana for lightning fast aggression or the Lana for a higher amount of healing and projectile attacks it's a great system that adds a near endless amount of variety and is perfect for experimenting with different approaches content-wise you've got a few other modes apart from the story that help round out the package with multiplayer allowing up to four players to jump into the action as well as others that test your skill like survival and time attack although the anime aspects of the game are a bit Over the Top If you're willing to look past them Arcana heart 3 is a solid fighting game and whether you're a casual button Masher or frame counting Pro there's plenty here to enjoy katsui is a p of an arcade shooter that first released in 2003 but in collaboration with cave 5pb brought the game to the PlayStation 3 offering a perfect translation of the arcade experience alongside a whole range of extras that elevated far beyond on just a simple Port as with many shooters The Narrative is quite minimal but it does at least give you some context as to what is going on with the game following two different Pilots tiger and Panza as they wage war against a shadowy organization who has their sights on world domination regardless of how sparse the story is gaml is the main attraction and on this front katsui delivers in Spades you get to control one of two ships each with unique firing modes you've got the wide ranging spread shot for crowd control and a focused laser for precision shots and switching between them on the Fly is the key to reaching the end as waves of enemies tanks drones and massive bosses flood the screen with intricate bullet patterns that demand split-second reflexes to overcome apart from taking on each threat the scoring system also manages to play a crucial role which is all centered around chips with their own numerical value that are dropped by each Target if you destroy an enemy of close to the chip drop will be a higher number and by collecting them as quickly as you can your score multiplier will increase but a single mistake will see it dropping back to zero this simple but effective system will no doubt keep you coming back for more as you chase that perfect run and with five stages each meticulously designed to test your skill and patience it's one of those games that are perfect to jump into when play in short bursts the best way to sum up super rubber dub would be Simplicity is this runs through nearly every aspect of the game may that be its visuals or gameplay which make it an exp experience that players of all ages can enjoy it's an absolute Master Class of game design and leverages the six-axis controller in a way that feels truly Innovative as the player you presented with a series of levels that task you with guiding your duck around by tilting the top with the controller this simple action manipulates the water and determines which direction your duck will head now scattered across each of the stages are bubbles with little ducks waiting to be popped which join up with you as you lead them to a drain to escape the level by now you're probably thinking this all sounds incredibly easy but what helps shake things up is the inclusion of several obstacles to navigate as well as sharks that stop at nothing to hunt you down there is a learning curve to be sure early attempts might see you overshooting turns or accidentally sending your Ducks into the shark's Jaws but once you get the hang of it the controls become second nature with over 60 stages spread across three different difficulties the game offers a gradual escalation that will keep you hooked throughout its short run time and as you advance the layouts grow more intricate weaving in tight Corners swirling whirlpools and fast moving currents that demand quick thinking and precise control some of the levels even flip the entire script and see you taken on the role of the Sharks as you try to Chomp down on as many ducks as you can for some extra points as well as a multiplayer mode which ends up being absolute Mayhem but a hell of a lot of fun even though the six axis seemed pretty pointless and a bit of an afterthought when the console released super rubub was the perfect example of how to implement it right licensed games usually get a bad rap and to be fair most of the time it's completely Justified but in the case of7 Bloodstone the developers set out to produce an entirely unique Adventure that wasn't based on a film and ended up being all the better for it the game kicks off in true Bond fashion with you having to stop an attack which sets the stage for a globe trotting Adventure that sees you visiting locals like Istanbul Bangkok and Monaco as you chase after a bioweapon that's being threatened to be unle leashed upon the innocent taking on the standard cover-based shooting mechanics that were so popular at the time controlling bond is extremely satisfying and you get to use a range of different weapons and gadgets to help get the job done one mechanic that helps it stand out though is the focus system that's earned by performing stealth takedowns unless you Mark and execute several enemies in slow motion channeling a lethal Precision we've all come to know and love from Bond further mixing things up at the several stealth sections that see you creeping through warehouses to snack some necks and disable alarms or one of the several driving segments that see you jumping into a car or boat as you chase down your target across the city what makes this game so special is just how well it captures the essence of bond without having a film to lean on or help prop it up with it being Penn by series veteran Bruce fierstein it stays incredibly true to the formula with shadowy villains double crosses and exotic characters that any fan of the brand will instantly feel familiar with and enjoy with it being quite cheap to pick up these and also a vision available on the PC if you're looking for a new third person shooter to play then Bloodstone is an easy recommendation stso brave Soldiers is a 3D fighter based on the anime of the same name and sees you stepping into the shoes of several characters from the show as they battle through the arcs of the story to protect their Goddess from cosmic threats the story mode is the real highlight and for fans of the source material it stays true to the key moments of the original series and while it's often conveyed through Stills instead of cutscenes it's still delivered with style thanks to the Japanese voice track that enhances the authenticity of the story now the game play is your standard fighting fair with both light and heavy attacks that can be chained into combos as well as character specific special moves that add a lot of depth to the roster while dashes Dodges and grabs keep the action flowing something known as the cosmo gauge is at the center of each fight and as you charge it up you get to perform your special attacks and ultimately awaken your 7even cents for a power boost or to Unleash Your Big Bang Attack each filling the screen with pure spectacle as meteors dragons or Flames tear your opponent apart sure it doesn't possess the same complexity that you'll find in other games like Street Fighter but its Simplicity is its strength allowing players of all skill levels to jump into the action and not have to worry about stringing together endless amounts of combinations to perform some of the more impressive moves apart from the story you've got a few other modes as well such as the galactic war that you against opponents in customizable tournaments survival mode that will test your endurance and finally multiplayer that's perfect for group play so whether you're a DI hard fan looking to relive moments from the show or a newcomer itching to get into a new fighting game Saints brave Soldiers is a solid Choice eat them is perhaps one of the most overlooked games on the PlayStation 3 and the fact that it never received a physical release probably contributed to its muted reception for any of you famili familiar with Rampage and old school arcade game etham is a somewhat spiritual successor and sees you jumping into a custombuilt robot under the command of a mad scientist that wants to wreak havoc against an oppressive Mega Corporation the story is pretty thin but it's delivered through comic style cut scenes that lend a playful nature to the otherwise laser focus on destruction that lies at the heart of the game it's your job to stomp through city streets toppling skyscrapers and Gobble up civilians to keep your monsters power meter in check and the control RS are pretty simple with your robot having a Punch Kick jump and grab that are all mapped to the face buttons allowing you to dive right into the Carnage without having to worry about a steep learning curve it's not all just about simply destroying everything inside though is each of the missions offer up different objectives to complete and one minute you're racing through checkpoints as a towering Beast the next you're smashing specific targets for a high damage score and you'll even find yourself rounding up zoo animals in bonus stages this variety ensures that it never becomes stale but by far the best thing the game has going for it is the monster lab and here you get to alter your beast from a growing selection of different parts that are unlocked by earning medals across one of the game's many different missions as you would expect each new part comes along with different stats and allows you to tailor your robot to suit the objective at hand with hundreds of different combinations available the customization ends up being a real standard although the game play is not exactly deep eat them is still a great time so if you're looking for some mindless destruction you should definitely give it a go the club is an action-packed third person shooter that frows several characters into the sedy world of underground death matches watched by faceless Elites who bet on the survival of the chosen Killers you get to choose from one of eight characters each covering different archetypes like X cops gamblers and drunks with the story being intentionally Bare Bones and the game instead focusing on what it knows to be its best asset and that's the game playay shooting and speed are at the center of the experience and you've got to contend with one of five different modes such as Survivor time attack Sprint Siege and run the gauntlet where you've got to build up your score by chasing points with a multiplier that rewards you for accuracy and speed longrange kills head shots and chaining your takedowns without breaking your streak allow you to rack up your score but there are also various elements throughout the environment that can help as well such as explosive barrels and Hidden Treasures that push it even further it's all about momentum forcing you to weave through hails of bullets Vault obstacles and keep the kill count climbing now without a huge arsenal of weapons to wield this simple premise might become a bit boring after a while but thanks to the range of different guns that you get to use from pistols to shotguns rocket launchers and rifles as well as the ability to melee attack and throw grenades it's a game that will keep you constantly on the edge of your seat and will push you to achieve the highest amount of points possible for those of you looking for something a bit different when it comes to third person shooters the club is a game that won't disappoint aaa's WRA is by far one of the craziest games of all time that fuses jaw dropping spectacle and unrelenting action into one of the most unique and exhilarating experiences in recent memory you take up the fight as a SORA a demigod betrayed by his fellow deities stripped of his power and cast down from the heavens after the murder of his family fueled by complete and total rage you reawakened 12,000 years later hellbent on Revenge and across several different chapters you take the fight to the gods that'll keep you on the edge of your seat from one explosive moment to the next in terms of gameplay it shares a lot in common with the likes of God of War and Devil May Cry with the action spanning three distinct Styles you've got the standard brawling on rail shooting sections as well as QuickTime events the fighting puts a heavy emphasis on your ability to perform combos by combining your light and heavy attacks to Pummel the waves of enemies and as you land hits you feel something known as the burst gauge which once full allows you to unleash what amounts to a finishing move that's delivered in a climactic cutscene with plenty of cinematography it gets insaner points but there in lies one of the main drawers of the game whether it's a SORA punch him through a continent sized enemy or hurling a foe far into space the scale and ambition on display is nothing short of mind-blowing the game does have a few quirks though and combat lacks the depth of its contemporaries that might disappoint those craving complex Combos and there of course the Reliance of on DLC to wrap up the game completely which can be a bit of a pain to get working that side though sar's raap is just pure adrenaline pumping fun and here's hoping that one day it makes return on Modern systems well that does it for another video keep an eye out for the next part as that will be coming up soon

there's an absolute ton of third-person shooters on the playstation 3 and while fuse is nowhere near one of the best it's still a competent adventure that manages to bring some new ideas to the table it sees you controlling one of four members of the overstrike specialist team a group of crack shot mercenaries who are called in to investigate a classified research facility and what starts off as a one-off crisis management job soon turns into an absolute nightmare it all revolves around a radioactive substance known as fuse and an organization named raven who are intent on threatening the world thankfully the gameplay is the strongest aspect of fuse with each of the overstrike members having access to a special weapon with one being able to absorb and propel bullets back towards the enemy as well as a selection of your standard shotguns pistols and machine guns that make the gunplay really compelling the controls actually work quite well and everything is tight and responsive allowing you to experiment with the various options you're given with ease a true sense of progression is provided by the leveling and skill tree system that allows you to develop your character with various abilities that have a meaningful impact on the gameplay but most notably is the inclusion of co-op that allows you to enjoy the campaign with up to three other players they stand in for your rover teammates and provide a much more enjoyable experience than when solely relying on the ai if this one passed you by when it first released it's still well worth picking up and giving a go blades of time shares much in common with the likes of heavenly sword and god of war but with one difference at its core it's built around the central mechanic that involves the manipulation of time and manages to create a refreshing and unique take on the genre as the player you are cast into the role of a yumi unlike all women who've done skimpy clothes and know a stunning selection of martial arts techniques she's a real force to be reckoned with now from a narrative perspective blades of time is a bit of a mess a yumi's multi-dimensional journey contains so many opposing factions that keeping everything coherent is as difficult as slaying the formidable foes who try to kill you on the gameplay front maneuverability is at its core that makes chopping down enemies a gratifying venture a umid glides across the ground with style and grace with a flashy dash allowing you to quickly dive in and out of the action your attacks are limited to only two buttons which means you don't have much diversity in your moves and there is a noticeable lack of weight in your heavy attacks however it doesn't take away from how well it controls positioning is vital and health is in short supply so rushing in to unleash a mini combo and then dashing back out is a sure way to survive it never quite reaches the highs of the games that have clearly inspired it but blade of time is still a great adventure and is now available on the switch if you fancy picking it up at first glance dark void plays a lot like years of war although you can say that about any third person shooter these days that actually works right in much the same way that every 3d platform around the market still owes something to mario 64. darkboy does something that makes all the difference in the world though it tries some new things and it puts some really interesting twists on the old ones and not only does it take these risks but they end up paying off the first new mechanic dark void introduces is the vertical cover system you can attach yourself to vertical cover and shoot up or down the enemies on other ledges the second really neat feature dark void introduces is that it gives you a jet pack and the mechanics involved is just really fun for example say some enemies are hiding behind cover you can flank them with a hover mode and shoot them with your rifle or enter flight mode and strafe them with your jetpack's armaments if enemy aircraft if enemy aircraft are attacking engage them in a dogfight with your jetpack or board them entirely kill the pilot and take the aircraft to yourself there's so many opportunities afforded to the player thanks to these mechanics but due to their complexity it can be a bit overwhelming at first as far as visuals go it's a sort of mixed bag the art direction is fantastic but the character models themselves are nothing spectacular nor are many of the textures i think it's mostly just a trait that had to be made in order to have such massive environments populated by so many enemies and npcs it does look its best whilst you're flying but i wouldn't say it looks too bad even when i'm close in short dark void is very good it's rough and does have a few problems that hold it back from being totally great but this game has a heart of gold and you can tell the guys making it really cared about what they were doing so if you're looking to grab something new on your playstation 3 it's well worth considering as many long time fans of the channel will know i'm a huge fan of ridge racer ever since its introduction on the playstation 1 it's a series that has constantly had my attention now when bounded is a completely different beast and just as the name suggests it's literally ridge racer with no limitations as a fan of the series i didn't really like how it deviated from the well-known formula but when judged on its own it's a pretty competent game it plays a lot like burnout in split second with a huge emphasis upon destruction as well as the ridge racer drifting mechanics cars leap streets explode and buildings crumble all while your competitors are turned into fiery slow-motion heaps of mouth just like the originals you've got a healthy selection of vehicles to choose from which are all unique in their own right when it comes to gameplay this is the biggest difference drifting still does play a role but instead of it feeling rather on rails it's a much more dynamic system that rewards the player for careful timing and my new tweaks of both your acceleration and steering if you overdo it you'll end up in a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] wall but undercook it and you won't even make it around the bend it takes a bit of getting used to but once you do you'll be screaming around the city in style just like the drifting the boost gauge has seen some changes as well whereas before it merely gave you a simple boost it's now essentially your main weapon of destruction your rivals can be flipped into twisted heaps of wreckage with a well-timed boost as well as buildings that stand in the way being reduced to rubble it's not just for the visual effect either as it all manages to play into the game and affect your progression although personally i'll always prefer the old take on the series there's no denying that unbounded is still a great time it led the return of matt hazard was first brought to the attention of gamers for an exclusive magazine preview a few months prior to its release it literally came out of nowhere and revolves around an overweight and out of work video game star known as matt has it the game script is its big draw created by the same writer who won an award for deadhead fred and it provides a constant barrage of game culture references and obvious parodies of real life properties it's quite easily its best aspect visually it's decent enough to get by but i can't help but feel that if given more time they could have been even better if you've played dark sector or uncharted then you know exactly what to expect here mac can carry up to two different weapons and switch between them on the fly leaning and aiming works just as it did in the aforementioned games but eat lead brings an interesting feature to the table while you're undercover you can aim at another cover spot and press triangle to instantly sprint over while not an overly exciting addition it was new at the time and helped the gameplay feel very tight and responsive and thankfully there's plenty of enemy types to put it to use on throughout the adventure matt has to go up against new and old foes from his previous games even 2d soldiers in some instances while not broken it is very vanilla you may begin to feel that old feeling have been there done that but overall it is an enjoyable adventure that any fan of third-person shooters will enjoy eternal sonata originally released for the xbox 360 and later received an updated vision for the ps3 that managed to retain everything that made the original so great all the while adding in some extra content that further progresses the story the events of the game mostly take place within the dreams of the main character but throughout the narrative the player will see themselves coming into contact with several levers that the story also focuses upon now like any other rpg the battling system is a very important aspect that can either make or break a game thankfully eternal sonata does not disappoint it's a turn-based formula and before carrying out each of your turns a short period of time is available to the player allowing them to move at will and take action with most of them being assigned to one of the face buttons but the standout aspect has to be the blocking system which soon becomes one of the more valuable mechanics in which to master it requires precise timing to counter an incoming attack and rewards the player by opening the enemy up to extra amounts of damage or completely interrupting their turn if you've yet to try this one out now is the perfect time it's bound to satisfy long time fans of the genre as well as those looking for something new to jump into alpha protocol is an often overlooked action rpg that never quite received the love and attention it deserved it sees players taking on the role of michael forten a secret agent part of a highly classified black ops agency who travels the world in order to unravel a conspiracy that threatens to put the entire human race in danger now the game does start off rather slow and is one most likely contributed to its muted success but if you stick it out alpha protocol soon begins to shine when it comes to gameplay it truly excels and as with most rpgs it'll see you developing your character over the course of the adventure which soon becomes one of the more compelling aspects of the game there's just so many damn options from soldier which focuses on using heavy guns to tech specialists that have a range of gadgets to use field agent which encourages the use of stealth and many many more which all help flesh out the gameplay and accommodate for any type of approach of course an extensive selection of weapons complement each of these roles and getting new equipment and upgrading your guns armor and gadgets is also good fun for anyone who enjoys the equipment and customization that many rpgs offer the best thing about alpha protocol however and what really makes the game is the way that you can choose to interact with and deal with the different characters and events you encounter a pretty robust dialogue system is in place and allows the player to steer the narrative in any direction they choose because of this subsequent playthroughs are all the more enjoyable thanks to the broad amount of ways you can tackle each situation unfortunately it's not all lollipops and rainbows it's alpha protocol is severely let down by some questionable technical issues such as severe screen tear and texture loading that plagues the entire game it's not a deal breaker but something that needs mentioning nonetheless all in all alpha protocol is a rough but extremely satisfying game if you're a fan of obsidian and the rpgs that they've become known for it's definitely worth checking out child of eden simply refuses to be an ordinary game when you first see it you'll believe that it's just an unreal shooter but it is much much more than that you take control of a cursor which serves as your only means of connecting with the world it sees you touching these graceful and magical creatures purging them of disease you're exploring living structures and systems reducing them to their essential forms you're pushing energy through chords into buds to evolve them into flowers you're creating life you're connecting opening and changing things around you it's not about killing it's about experiencing i originally played it using the motion controller but after trying the dual shock as well it does hold up it takes a while to get used to but it soon feels natural to glide your hand over strange and cute butterfly creatures or paint big blue mantra rays and then shape the controller to release colorful lasers that purify your targets there aren't many stages but each one is packed so full with things to see and touch that it's quite overwhelming each environment has a different vibe and thankfully there's an escalating sense of difficulty that will keep players engaged but there's other stages that are just about relaxing enjoying the ambiance and exploring the strange and beautiful space creatures and the music reflects the tone perfectly ultimately though it's the sheer quality and variety of visual effects that maybe didn't stand out there's just so much [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] going on at any one time wireframe cubes throb and pulsate in unison millions of tiny white stars sparkle like a shimmering blanket fields of colorful shapes bloom on the surface of water which makes it one of the most beautiful looking games i've ever played now it won't be for everyone but if you can get past the rather challenging setup it soon becomes a rewarding and engaging journey if there is one word that could sum up wet it would have to be ambition but unfortunately it fights off more than it can chew and ends up falling short of brilliance that's not saying it's a bad game by any means but the result is something that feels only partially complete wet is a third-person action adventure shooter platformer that wants to do well at all of these and only really succeeds in its shooting elements the rest is all functional and technically works but you'll have seen it done much more successfully in other games however because of its shooting mechanics its grindhouse aesthetic it's sense of humor and it's gleefully profane protagonist ruby you'll end up having a lot of fun with it the plot if you can even call it that involves ruby doing a job succeeding at doing that job and then being betrayed by the person who paid her to do the job she then sets out on revenge and this is where the game picks up the core of the game has you in a standard third person shooter mode with one real difference ruby is acrobatic and when you're in the acrobatic mode jumping wall running and sliding along the ground on your knees you'll get to shoot with both of your weapons and bullets on this is the best aspect that wep brings to the table this central mechanic once you get hold of it helps the game stand out from all of its contemporaries and for the six or so hours that you'll be playing the game it really doesn't get boring in all honesty it's the non-gameplay aspect that i like the most about wet it looks like a grindhouse film from the 70s or more recently a tarantino movie it sounds like one too but it's loud rocking soundtrack and profanity-laden dialogue wet is pretty rough around the edges but if you can look past some of the more disappointing aspects of the game it soon becomes rather enjoyable el shaddai is a simple hack and slash with several platforming elements thrown in for grip measure in fact the game is clearly divided equally between the two genres with the journey taking you through various flaws of the tower that the angels who are tracking down created it sees you fighting small demons on the way to each of these angels which serve as the boss of each floor the closest reference to the feel of the combat would have to be devil may cry but a much more minimal and stripped down version there's only really two buttons that you'll use to fight one being a mid-air attack and the other being a special move that is either offensive or evasive in nature now the combat can be considered button-mashy but thanks to the inclusion of several abilities known as god weapons a bit more variety and strategy is afforded to the gameplay there are three in total a heavy shield that is slow but strong on offense and defense a lightsaber styled sword that's quite fast and fairly strong and finally a strange long-range shooting weapon that's quite hard to describe but it's fast and allows the player to dash around switching between all of them on the fly soon becomes the order of the day and provides a means to outsmart the enemy this is one tough game and is likely to test even the most proficient of players so if you're looking for a challenge el-shaddai will be right up your street well that does it for today's video keep an eye out for part three as that will be coming up soon so don't forget to hit subscribe and tickle that bell you can

Eternal Sonata originally released for the Xbox 360 and later received an updated released for the PlayStation free that managed to retain everything that made the original so great all the while adding in some extra contacts that FIFA progresses the story the events of the game mostly take place within the dreams of the main character before out the narrative the player will see themselves coming into contact with several levers that the story also focuses upon now like any other RPG the battling system is a very important aspect of the experience and eternal sonata does not disappoint before carrying out each turn a period of time is available to the player allowing them to move a will and to take action with most of them being assigned to one of the face buttons but the standout aspect has to be the blocking system which soon becomes one of the more valuable mechanics in which to master ever wires precise timing to counteract an attack and rewards the player by opening the enemy up to after amount of damage or completely interrupting their turn if you've yet to try this one out now is the perfect time it's bound to satisfy longtime fans of the genre as well as those looking for something new to get into after the huge success of the first Mass Effect it wasn't long until the sequel arrived which brought with it several improvements and new additions to help elevate it beyond the original iteration players once again assumed the role of Commander Shepard and have thrown into an adventure that I will see them exploring the entire galaxy and encountering many situations in which to overcome those familiar with the franchise will already know about the extreme emphasis Mass Effect 2 places upon its narrative throughout the experience the player is presented with several dialogue options that play into a system which essentially developed your character iver is a great person or a renegade that has the potential to alter the story which makes it perfect for subsequent playthroughs when compared to the original the gameplay takes on a more action orientated approach which manages to meet each encounter all the more tense but with the hordes of abilities and weapons in your disposal you'll never be at a loss on how to tackle each one Mass Effect 2 represents some of Bioware's finest work and is one game which should not be passed up trails of cult still sees the player assume in the role of green a high school student who is involved with a local military academy the story follows rien and his fellow classmates as they learn about the harsh realities of the power struggle between several forces within the kingdom gameplay-wise it manages to retain much from the series routes and presents them all in a new way battles play out in a turn-based fashion with a new mechanic in the form of a tactical link system taking center stage it allows the player to follow up on attacks with his selection of abilities that ultimately deal artax with damage to the enemy or benefit the party as a whole when not in battle the player will find themselves exploring a diverse set of locations as well as interacting with the various NPCs the game introduces along the way which soon becomes a real highlight of the experience although not absolutely perfect in its execution trails of cold steel still manages to offer up one of the finest RPGs available on the system and is bound to satisfy both fans of the genre as well as newcomers alike Starro team the last hope sees the player embarking upon a journey through space in order to ultimately locate a new planet for Humanity it is a prequel to the first entry in the franchise players assume the role of a character known as edge and acquire a whole team of allies for after journey that helped increase their chances of fulfilling the mission gameplay wise each battle is presented in real-time and relies upon a series of combos and special abilities in which to overcome each encounter several mechanics are also in place though such as the blindside ability that allows you to quickly dash out of the range of your target and approach them from behind it rewards you in several ways the most meaningful being the opportunity to deal out critical hits there's a real sense of progression afforded to the experience and half of the fun is really gettin stuck into each character's specific strengths and weaknesses and figuring out the best way to develop each over the course of the game it's a pretty sizable adventure as well and will last most players quite some time so if you're looking for an RPG to sink some time into Star Ocean The Last Hope offers up a great option Dragon's Dogma is an action RPG which sees the player assuming the role of a customizable hero to combat a great threat in the form of a dragon known as grigory the gameplay is presented in a hack-and-slash fashion with the combat at first seemingly quite basic in its execution but after some time of the game it soon becomes apparent that it offers a deeper experience that allows the player to command a whole host of technical attacks and abilities joining you on your journey are several companions in his pawns which help deal out extra damage during encounters as well as hints and tips we'll explore him and taping on quests within the world players can choose from several different types of classes ranging from archers assassins sorcerers and much more that all offer their own distinct abilities and advantages depending on the situation you find yourself in Dragon's Dogma is now available on a wide range of systems making it now easier than ever to jump into this classic as a longtime fan of the genre I've always had a special place for the tale series especially Tales of Symphonia which originally released for the Nintendo GameCube way back in 2004 upon hearing it would be ported to the PlayStation 3 along with its sequel I was eager to try it out I was not at all disappointed to me it is a perfect example of a timeless RPG an epic well paced narrative absolutely filled with adventure and intrigue as well as a lovable cast of characters that managed to flesh out the world and believability of the events that transpire but the real star of the show has to be the battle system that is presented in real time and sees the player taking control of up to four party members each with their own distinct abilities and advantages the main aspect of each encounter focuses upon filling a bar known as the Unison gauge which results and all of the party members coming together to unleash devastating amounts of damage upon enemies there are a ton of options when it comes to each of your characters thanks to the inclusion of a gem system that allows the player to customize each to their specific style play if this one passed you by back in the day now is the perfect time to jump in and experience it for yourself no RPG list would be complete without acknowledging Skyrim it's the fifth installment in a series that has managed to run for decades and it's easy to see why the sheer level of freedom on offer throughout the experience is incredible and paves way for the many ways in which the game can be played a whole range of options are on offer so if you had the type of player that likes to focus upon magical abilities or one that professor more hands-on approach Skyrim has got you covered thanks to the ton of abilities and spells that can all be developed and learned over the course of the adventure combat is quite simple in its execution with each action being assigned to the shoulder buttons allowing players to mix which ever attacks they desire overall Skyrim is the perfect game for anyone interested in a fantasy sandbox is not perfect by any means but the pros vastly outweigh the cons so if you're looking to lose yourself within an RPG and have surprisingly not played it yet Skyrim offers up a great option that would make a nice addition to every PS rihanna's collection and with it now being available on a whole range of systems there's never been a better time to jump in Dark Souls is the spiritual successor to demon souls another fantastic experience on the PlayStation free and is well worth a look as well personally I feel Dark Souls managed to improve and expand upon the many aspects that game introduced and for that reason alone it deserves a place here on this list essentially an action RPG Dark Souls can be rough I mean real rough you'll find yourself wanting to quit out of sheer frustration at times due to the incredible amount of difficulty but for those that stick around and learn the more intricate aspects of the mechanics in place it soon becomes one of the most rewarding experiences on the PlayStation free a wide array of weapons armor accessories and magic help level the playing field and with many ways in which to upgrade each there are plenty of options when it comes to developing your character but if you were to die during battle all of that progress is lost if you are unable to return to the location of your defeat it's an interesting setup and manages to constantly push the player to learn and adapt on the fly depending on the situation they find themselves in if you've yet to try Dark Souls art it's now available on a whole range of systems and would make a perfect addition to anyone's collection ninokuni is a rather special RPG that brings the talent of level 5 and studio ghibli together and a mesmerizing tale that is bound to have a profound impression upon those who experience it players assume the role of a young boy known as Oliver who unfortunately after a tragic loss is plunged into an adventure that sees him travelling between worlds in order to counteract a back in an evil one aspect that will strike most players is the sheer size of the world in which the events take place there is a real sense of exploration that obviously a first is quite limited but once you delve deeper into the story it begins to open up more a reveal a huge variety of locations which are all unique in their presentation gameplay wise ninokuni truly comes into its own the battling system was not strictly turn-based offers up plenty of options in strategy mainly in the form of familiars a collection of little monsters that share much in common with the likes of Pokemon each of the major in battle and bring their own distinct abilities to the table ninokuni is a traditional RPG in every sense of the word and in my opinion is all the more better for it so if you're looking for a slice of RPG perfection on the PlayStation 3 it would make a worthy addition to your collection if there is one word that could sum up persona 5 that word would have to be style everything from the environments characters music and even down to the menus are presented in a way that lends the experience a truly unique feel like many RPGs the player will find themself assuming the role of a mute protagonist who is sent to live with a family friend after a rather unfortunate situation lands him in trouble with the law once there he starts attending the local high school which sees him forming bonds with several other students as they begin to unravel the mysteries surrounding the area gameplay is mainly split into two types you'll find yourself participating and a whole range of activities that all have an effect upon your characters proficiency or exploring dungeons which form the main aspect of the game it's here you'll encounter enemies and take advantage of the incredible combat system that revolves around entities known as personas which allow each character to perform devastating attacks and overcome the diverse set of situations you'll find yourself encountering if the SONA 5 passed you by or you have yet to jump into the series it provides a perfect jumping on point as well as one of the finest RPGs on the PlayStation 3 you

damnation is a third-person shooter that before it released sounded like an absolute winner mixing elements of platforming exploration and shooting all wrapped in a steampunk themed world on the brink of civil war the concept was extremely appealing but then it actually released this story revolves around the man known as hamilton a member of a rebel gang trying to stop the rise of an evil industrialist named prescott however for hamilton stopping prescott is only half of the battle as he's also trying to track down his missing fiance which winds up having something to do with presbyter as well basically the narrative is just a convoluted mess and extremely cliche the spoken dialogue doesn't do it any favors either of course just because the story is bad the gameplay can always make up for it well with damnation you're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of luck as it's just as broken and nonsensical as the plot for a game that sees you spending most of your time shooting you would have thought that this area would be pretty solid but no matter which weapon you're using except for the sniper rifle or anything that explodes it will take a ridiculous amount of rounds to take even the weakest of enemies out even at close range the bullets you fire seemed to spread outward to create an outline around your target instead of hitting what is damn right in front of you in situations like this the brain dead ai actually comes in handy as you can safely pop off each enemy from a distance with your sniper rifle without any of them moving a muscle in the end damnation really is a sad story the game had an interesting concept and a good amount of potential but it just never came together it really was unfortunate to see it fail in just about every aspect because even if it had gotten one thing right perhaps i could have still found an audience happy to check it out however as it is i can't imagine anyone enjoying the time with it i cannot even begin to explain how fast x-blades becomes boring the narrative sees you taking up the role of a yumi a relic hunter who's on the search for an artifact that is said to hold the fate of the world in its grasp warfare starts out quite intriguing soon descends into complete bollocks and by the time the credits roll you'll wonder why you wasted your time x-blades is the very definition of frustration and annoyance the combat is complete [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] chaos legitimate play mechanics are thrown out the window in favor of wildly mashing the axe button and doing aoe magic attacks every 5 seconds the yumi's blades and guns are not only extremely weak there is no sense of them ever really connecting with anything the only way you know that your attacks are connecting with an enemy is that they are not swinging at you seriously how many times can you hit a monster with your blades and not have them die apparently a lot the way yumi unleashes her combos contributes to this feeling of disconnection she just kind of throws her blades out there in a haphazard way that doesn't seem to have much to do with how the player is pressing out you'll quickly realize that the best course of action is to forsake the targeting system mash the axe button and unleash a surround spell every few seconds to get the groveling hordes around you off your ass speaking of the targeting system i want to know who the knob was that decided to have it randomly fix on an enemy a hundred meters away or even monsters that haven't even popped their heads up from the ground it feels like it was implemented just to give the player a hard time instead of making the combat feel more streamlined and manageable in the hands of a more talented developer we could have had a real winner on our hands but at most exploiters are fart in the wind ayumi's exposed butt cheeks are a constant reminder of that do yourself a favor and pick up god of war instead sometimes you just randomly pick up a game something about the title draws you in the box art looks appealing whatever i honestly can't say what i was expecting with magus a so-so action rpg is probably the closest that i thought the game was going to be what i was not expecting was a third-person shooter there are some minor rpg elements in magus stats to sync points into different types of magic to progress but really that's a minor aspect the three types of magic are green for major offensive magic health and a couple of defensive spells blue which is comprised of energy attacks the ability to float and some other spells that affect the space around enemies lastly there's red which are based on necromancy and let you summon the corpses of the enemies you've killed and really that's kind of it the problem is that half of the time these spells don't even [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] work most attempts result in the enemies doing nothing in relation to the spell you've used no damage nothing just a drain on the mana pool because of this you'll find yourself settling into a few that actually do something which might have been a bigger issue with the combat actually being challenging enemies will occasionally stab at you if you stand there and wait for the fort to occur to them there is no challenge to speak of even with the difficulty slider cranked to the max when the game isn't having you kill piles upon piles of similar enemies it decides to do conversation the conversations almost always whittled down to let's kill these guys or let's kill these guys super painfully it really doesn't make any effort to show the main character in any sympathetic or likable light but simply magus is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] there are no redeeming factors that help it stand out the novelty of it being a fantasy game that's a shooter will wear out really quick and what you're left with is a complete rack of the game that isn't even worth the disc it's printed on right from the beginning the writing was on the wall when it comes to rogue warrior after initially being scrapped by the original developers and then being picked up by rebellion a few years later it's a game that seems to have never been able to reach the lofty expectations that it set itself based loosely on the exploits of former navy seal richard dick mckinko rogue warrior tells the completely fictitious story of the hero himself as he attempts to neutralize north korean missile launch capability and that is literally the extent of the plot there are sections in between missions with dicks riveting commentary on the current situation making an attempt to disguise itself as an intelligent and cohesive plot but it ultimately falls flat with no amount of one-liners or attempts at comedy being able to save the dire state of the narrative you know it's probably not a great start whilst playing rogue warrior that within the first five minutes or so of gameplay you come to the conclusion that this is probably the least amount of fun you've ever had what was originally pitched is a broad open-ended tactical shooter was instead a linear and painstakingly generic shooter with all the charm of a wet mop levels usually consist of moving from objective marker to objective marker shooting up bad guys along the way and doing really not much else there were no puzzles no bosses or even any collectibles or minor distractions along the way it's just straight up dull for a game that came out around the midpoint of the playstation 3's life cycle visually rogue warrior rivals the greatest of wii titles the cold war environments are extremely generic and dull as are the basic textures that illustrate them the animations are robotic and as stiff as they've come and the weapons and explosive effects are a major embarrassment to the console's power and potential overall rogue warrior is just embarrassing it's the perfect example of a developer reaching higher than they can reach with the result being one of the worst games to ever see the light of day on the playstation 3.

much like its name suggests girl fight is a fighter that is made up of an entirely female cast and i have nothing against the concept a perfect example would be skull girls which was an incredible fighting game based around the idea of a roster completely comprised of women but the difference between that game and this one is night and day when in combat it comes across as a sort of dead or a life club with many of the inputs and abilities being mapped to the same buttons but unlike its clear inspiration it has nowhere near the same amount of combos or special moves to make it feel satisfying there's not much difference between each of the characters with most of them sharing the same abilities and techniques which really takes the fun out of trying them all out i will give the game some credit though the psionic abilities are certainly interesting and can be activated once you've built up enough meter by performing hits they all have a variety of uses such as steel body that allows the fighter to take more damage or life leech an ability that will take a bit of the opponent's health and add it to yours with every hit while there isn't a huge selection to choose from these psionic powers do give girl fight a piece of personality a sense that the developers aren't just mindless zombies that can't come up with their own ideas sadly while it's a good mechanic it's still trapped in a shockingly terrible playstation 3 game now for everything that it gets wrong girl fight is actually quite a good looking game with all of the characters and backgrounds possessing a nice amount of creativity and a solid frame rate to bring it all together but that's about the only good thing to be said about the game if you're a fan of the genre and are looking for something new on the playstation 3 this is definitely one to avoid if you're not willing to put up with some of its shortcomings they always say the biggest form of flattery is imitation and it's clear to see where smash and survive got its inspiration mainly the burnout series and destruction derby but instead of providing a cohesive and enjoyable experience it's a complete mess that will just steal your time it's essentially a car combat game that sees you taken on the part of a rookie who's looking to join a gang known as the necromancers right at the beginning your vehicle will have absolutely no weapons attached but by progressing through the campaign you soon come into a range of weaponry and new cars with saw blades flame throwers pulse emitters and other weapons naturally each car has their own attributes mainly in strength handling and acceleration which makes them suitable for specific missions you'll be asked to complete there's a few types as well from deathmatch to base defense and bombing runs which help mix it up now you're probably wondering this all sounds positive so what gives well the main aspect that lets smashing survive down is actually playing the game the handling of each car is straight up [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] no matter what your handling stat may be for any specific vehicle it's incredibly difficult to just simply drive around often the problematic driving seems linked to the broken physics engine as on more than one occasion i found myself pressing right on the joystick and going straight or left cars also have a terrible tendency to get caught on the terrain and inexplicably flip or even the slightest touch considering that the entire point of the game is to kill opponents using weapons the difficulty in driving the vehicles within the game only makes aiming them and targeting vulnerable areas of an opponent's car that much more annoying this is truly the definition of a terrible game i don't know what it is maybe it was produced on an extremely tight budget but that still doesn't excuse the fact that it fails on nearly every level now when it comes to video games based on movies it is always a bit of a mixed bag sure there are some diamonds in the rough but more often than not they completely suck balls and they're just created to capitalize upon a popular name rambo the video game falls into that category and recreates many of the iconic moments from the films but fails to impress when it comes to gameplay first off it's entirely on rails which severely limits the amount of freedom the player has sure there's plenty of unreal shooters which are actually quite good but what let's rambo down is the severe lack of variety that makes playing through it a complete and utter troll your goal is simple you move the reticle across the screen until you line it up with an enemy on fire sounds easy right well this is where the wonky as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] auto win feature comes into play that should have been called auto miss instead as it violently throws you off target time and time again couple this with the fact that hit detection is not non-existent with many of the shots just clearly going straight through the enemy with no effect it quickly becomes a huge problem as you try to advance through the game thankfully this isn't the only aspect that makes up the experience sprinkled throughout the main campaign there's several quicktime events that at least offer a change of pace and save you from the tedious main attraction that are meant to be the shooting sections it's just bad design but there's got to be a saving grace right what about this huge amount of fans of the films they'll surely enjoy it well aside from the shockingly ugly character models what is actually quite cool is that all of the characters that appear are voiced by the original voice actors they claim they receive the original voice word from the studio but to be fair it just sounds like a straight up recording of a vhs so no there is no silver lining no saving grace just pure and utter bollocks the playstation 3 was home to an incredible amount of rpgs but as with most consoles a few stinkers managed to crawl their way out of the gate with less rebellion being one of them to get this over with yes last rebellion is crap however it will appeal to a very select and small crowd of rpg fans you know like something that is good in a crappy way and last rebellion is exactly that while it wasn't even close to being good on any level i came to appreciate some aspects of it but the major thing that brings it down is that it feels like a high school project everything about the game's presentation looks cheap half-assed and amateur hitmapper's production values have never been very high but if that's saying anything even dragon ears area and blade dancer looked better and they were on the psp last rebellion is almost unacceptable as playstation 3 game needless to say the cutscenes are pretty boring to watch only the voice acting gives some life to the pathetic character interactions but is not the best around ranging from acceptable to cringe and juicing that really takes away from the narrative that the game is trying to tell it's the kind of crappy rpg some people will like mind you there's a fan base for bad games and last rebellion exactly fits that bill it's far from being good but it's playable and the bad stuff is actually what makes it charming the game feels so low budget like something that is not totally fully fledged but something that could have been good i did like some aspects of it the battle system was interesting to say the least and it had this kind of dark gloomy feeling that some people will like as well but the whole thing felt rushed and incomplete the areas are dull and empty there's just nothing to do the game is overly easy and the experience as a whole just doesn't feel compelling or rewarding if you're looking for a new rpg to get stuck into this isn't it as any long time viewer of the channel will know i'm a huge fan of horror from silent hill to haunting grounds and resident evil it's a genre that i've always had a connection with but for every good game there's always one that disappoints and amy unfortunately falls into the latter it's essentially a third-person survival horror that sees you cast as lana a lady with psychic abilities i'll be honest the first chapter of amy does offer a glimmer of hope that your money is being spent on something worthwhile it opens on a train and after a huge explosion forces you to get off the next station you find it infested with zombies that do manage to provide a real sense of terror now combat in amy suffers from the same thing the saw video game suffered from which is the fact that whoever hits first will win the fight if you get hit you're most likely stuck in a loop until death right off the bat you'll know to now be avoiding enemies and hoping that somehow the gameplay gets better if amy had a saving grace it would definitely be the puzzles or cooperative aspects between lana and amy herself even though the puzzles contain no logic they are fun you'll have amy entering rooms via crawl spaces hitting switches grabbing key cards operating elevators and much more unfortunately things go downhill and amy's real issues unfold right before your eyes as you progress amy contains a ridiculous amount of trial and error most of the time i was playing i was wandering around aimlessly without a clue as to what i should be doing i understand that it's a survival horror and wouldn't even have minded but unfortunately amy is played with extremely cheap deaths a section that should take maybe five minutes with a competent checkpoint system will take you a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hour finally there's a camera that constantly messes you up by going completely awol summing amy up is a mess just doesn't do it justice i would rather repeatedly castrate myself with a fork than play this game and truthfully that would be far more entertaining right to hell retribution is an absolute travesty of a game and you know me guys i'll always give a game a fair shake and even report some positives if i think they need to be noted but this one is a completely different story the game pretty much declares how bad it's going to be from the very start by literally throwing you into a turret section as the first screen after mindlessly shooting random enemies without a clue as to what's going on the game instantly throws you into another generic section of action games a quick time event bro after that you're given a quick scene of the main character jake shooting some poor dude on the ground it's like the game is just running through a checklist of mediocre game design turret section check qte fight check a scene that tries extra hard to look cool is the main character shooter guy check from there you are transported to one of the main gameplay mechanics of the experience which is on your motorcycle from here the game goes from mediocre to absolute terrible as you discover how horribly the controls or lack thereof handle the motorcycle segments which ought to be a highlight of the game are just padded sections of boredom with unruly physics all that happens in these areas is you drive down long winding roads with an occasional button prompt to power slide or fight our fellow bikers that magically materialize out of nowhere half the time you won't even have to is the enemy's life to suddenly take off at light speed and ram into walls before exploding it's almost as if the ai of the game doesn't even want to play the bike sections are not the only parts of the game that play poorly however pretty much every aspect of the game is broken both melee combat and gunfights which made me learn right away how repetitive and frustrating the game can be the entire design is nonsensical the story and world are lifeless and the way women are portrayed in the game takes it from being horrible to downright disgusting this is one for the bin well that does it for today's video keep an eye out for part two as that will be coming up soon so don't forget to hit

### Transcript
foreign ER Gunners the first game you'll likely think of is Contra and hardcore's Uprising serves as a prequel to that entire series it introduces us to a world that is run by an Empire who flat off destroyed anything that gets in the way of their plans to rule each and every nation on the earth that is until a handful of skilled Warriors finally arrived to turn the situation around and this is where the player comes in you get to choose from several characters who reach out their own skills as well as pros and cons that may even Ichigo essential to see which one you better settle into as with most games of this type you'll find yourself jump into a vague incoming fire as well as replying in kind with this huge selection of weapons that can pulverize the enemy to complement this there's also a selection of power-ups which augment your abilities such as brief stints of invincibility as well as increased damage or defense which all have a role to play throughout each level and trust me you'll be needing them as hardcore surprising is one of those games that isn't afraid to kick you whilst you're down and although the extreme amount of difficulty may turn some players away it's nothing that can't be overcome by the end of grips with each and every mechanic in play now one aspect that blew me away with the presentation Arc system works have always been known for their incredible Sprite work and here with hard corpse it is on Full display each playable character and enemy are lovingly detailed as well as the various effects that light up the screen when the action starts to hit up this is only bolstered by the solid frame rate that never misses a beat no matter how intense the encounter may be overall if you're a fan of the Contra games then hardcorps will likely satisfy or even exceed your expectations so if you like the look of it there's never been a better time to try it out for yourself if there was one word that could sum up a guided fate Paradox it would have to be weird but it's that good kind of weird that only ever seems to come out of Japan it seems you literally becoming a God and granting the wishes of those that Pray by entering a sort of simulation which allows you to answer these calls to the Divine one of the best aspects of the game is without a doubted script Now where's this weirdness like a badge of honor and it isn't afraid to have some fun whilst doing so you'll come across all sorts of colorful characters throughout the story which managed to add a real wit to the events that transpire as well as a few laughs is the banter between them plays out however like most RPGs they either live or die on the combat system alone and luckily the guy did fake Paradox poles no punches in this department as well all of the action takes place on a grid which is occupied by a series of enemies and traps that stop at nothing to bring you down of course you've got several options when it comes to dealing with them from standard attacks to more devastating magic abilities but unlike many games of its kind you won't be contending with leveling up your character but instead improving the equipment have over the course of the adventure nearly every piece has a skill associated with it and the more you use it the more experience you gain it's a great little system that incentivizes scouring for as many items as you can in the hopes of finding one that will make each and every encounter all the more easier although the guided fake Paradox is a very challenging game with a constant threat of being overwhelmed and losing everything you've achieved it's this sense of risk versus reward that makes it such a compelling experience if you've never got around to playing it when it first released then you owe it to yourself to give it a go Anarchy Reigns is essentially a 3D beatama perpetu into the shoes of one of several characters as you make your way through several campaigns taking place in the dystopian future where pollution has taken its toll on the environment and as a result the population has been transformed into mutated Horrors amongst this it's your job to try and locate a notorious criminal and bring him to Justice now the story itself isn't anything to write home about but does provide an incentive to keep going throughout the campaign and with the surprisingly cheerful and cheesy nature of its character you'll meet and never once feels like a slot on the gameplay front this is where Anarchy Reigns really comes into its own and sees each character having the ability to perform basic attacks such as punching and kicking but also gives them several special techniques that are really effective depending on the situation at hand as you land success for the tax you fill up two different meters first you've got the special attack meter which allows you to modify your light and heavy moves by mixing in a weapon with each attack that's unique to each character and then there's the rage meter that went default does exactly what it says on the tin and allows you to go batshier crazy with increased amounts of speed and damage the boot there are some combos you can perform as well that are based on the timing of your light and heavy attacks and while it's not extremely deep there is enough variation to keep it fresh but what really kept me coming back for more though has to be the generous amount of replay value that the game brings to the table from Collectibles that unlock various costumes and concept art to entirely new characters such as fan favorite Bayonetta to play with it's one of those games you'll find hard to put down but actually rewards you for the time you spend with it all in all it's over the top and ridiculous premise and gameplay I'll know that I'll keep you on the edge of your seat right up until the credits of raw with the exception of Crash Bandicoot's other video game developers have attempted to break into the kart racing genre but none of them have been able to compete with Mario Kart for the top spot the last Contender for this title you'd think of would be a game based on a Mexican cartoon show but El Chavo actually offers up a rather compelling tape on the tried and tested formula by injecting a serious amount of humor as well as its own new Nick take on the gameplay you'd expect to find now the game is divided into three separate modes with cups challenges and exhibition the cups provide the main drawer of the game and see you competing in several tournaments that unlock various rewards upon completion but challenges where most of the fun Riser is a tier where El Chavo steals the shop it offers a range of objectives to fulfill such as weaving in and out of oncoming traffic to capture the flag style mini-games that inject a serious amount of fun and really shine during multiplayer sessions now when it comes to the gameplay it is largely identical to Mario Kart and that's not a bad thing at all one distinction though is that you can attempt to jump on top of your rivals or even ran into them with the right analog stick this adds another layer of worry to its race because your opponents are capable of doing the same and when coupling this with the various items and boosts found littered across each track absolute Mayhem is almost guaranteed every time you start up your engine even though it could be summed up as a copycat of sort at least I'll travel tries a few different things to help it stand out amongst its contemporaries so if you're looking for a fun game to jump into with a few friends on the PlayStation 3 El Chavo is just a ticket and will provide hours upon hours of Engagement gameplay right of the Argonauts is an action RPG that takes place in ancient Greece and tells the story of Jason a mythological character who's on a quest to locate a mysterious artifact like many games in the genre you'll find yourself visiting a diverse set of locales meeting various NPCs and getting stuck into combat where the game is arguably at its best you've got a good selection of abilities to get the job done and Jason can wield a variety of weapons such as Spears to Misses and swords which all have their own strengths on the battlefield while some may be slow they provide more amounts of damage with others allowing you to quickly Dodge or Parry so switching between them on the Fly according to what is happening at the time is the main key to overcoming the various obstacles the gamepads for weapons aren't the only option you have though when it comes to combat as there is also various types of magic if you get to wield as well known as God Powers they allow you to heal yourself for members of your party as well as bump your resistance and damage and even slow down time to take care of large groups of enemies in a Flash one notable aspect of the gameplay though has to be the various dialogue options you're presented with throughout the story which ends up feeling like Mass Effect in ancient Greece these options actually have meaningful outcomes which help promote subsequent playthroughs in order to see everything the game has to offer if you're a fan of God of War or just action RPGs in general then rise of the Argonauts officer for respectable take on Greek mythology all the while delivering enjoyable gameplay that doesn't just feel like a run-of-the-mill match to win a fit if you can find it on the cheap it is well worth adding to your collection painkiller hell and Damnation is a first-person shooter that Harkens back to the days of old and is far more focused on simply blasting enemies into Oblivion and providing much more beyond that it's basically a remake of the Gory original and sees you taken on the role of Daniel Garner who finds himself trapped in a hellish environment and his only option is to do what he does best in order to escape and that is slaying everything in sight without its second thought gameplay-wise he shares much uncommon with the likes of Doom and Duke Nukem 3D and sees you charging through hordes of beasts all the while taken advantage of some seriously inventive Weaponry the Absurd bloodbath that develops is a visceral and the times gut-wrenching experience but the comical script and somewhat campy nature of the narrative provide a nice contrast to the otherwise brutal aspects of the game however as I just mentioned one of the highlights of the gameplay has to be the Gunplay and the various weapons that you'll get to use throughout each level the well-rounded variety gives you a lot of flexibility when it comes to engaging enemies and experimenting with each of them is one of the game's biggest draw from the handheld painkiller blender that purees targets at point-blank range to the wooden Spike gun and screw his opponents the walls and even though you're often sworn by enemies throughout the game all of these options come together to level the playing field and give you a Fighting Chance painkiller hell is of great return to the days of a classic shooter and proves that you don't need to bog down a game with unnecessary crap as long as the foundation is solid with its grip in gameplay and beautiful visuals to match hell and Damnation is one game you do not want to miss when it comes to fighting games on the PlayStation 3 the console had its fair share of options with big hitters like Tekken and Street Fighter making their mark But as a result many lesser known games suffered because of it and would be relegated Into Obscurity one of them is Battle Fantasia that is by far one of the most underrated fighting games on the system as with most Fighters you're presented with a selection of characters which all possess the same basic moves such as punches and kicks but Branch out when it comes to their individual abilities and special attacks the game plays similar to Street Fighter in his most slow paced when compared to Arc Works other fighting series Guilty Gear but it still possesses a lot of depth in the systems that comprise the gameplay you've got parries that can help you out when you find yourself in a tight spot as well as something known as gachi Drive which when activated let your character Advance forward and depending on which version you've used you can either juggle your opponent or live together attacks like wouldn't normally do so now visually battle Fantasia has a look it can call its own it's clear that a lot of love and attention went into the presentation of each character in stage and when you couple this with the 60fps count it ends up being incredibly easy on the ice and with how frantic each battle can become you'll be all the more thankful for it when it comes down to it despite not having the biggest cast around battle Fantasia manages to make each and every one of them feel unique and fun to play the battle mechanics aren't anything new but it executed rather well and ended up making it one of the more compelling fighting games you'll find on the console so if you're a fighting fan who leans more towards the old school style of the genre and this is one game you won't want to miss coming from the mind of suda51 short piece is absolutely brimming with his brand of originality and offers up his side-scrolling shooter that sees you dashing across each level and pounding enemies into submission now the game is actually more film than game and is made up of four short animations with the gameplay interjected throughout these short films cover a wide range of topics that are Central to Japanese philosophy including the clash between humanity and technology and the Japanese sense of spirituality in their relationship to Nature buffer as enjoyable as they are it's the gameplay that really sat short piece on a path to success it's fast frantic and unforgiving at points but you've got enough ways to hold your run that it never feels like an impossible task in addition to a sword for slashing you've been briefly hover in the air after a jump as well as Clint to walls which all have a role to play in keeping your momentum going by sliding downhill thanks to this sense of speed there's a real sense of reward once you get a grips with it is ducking and Diving around each level all the while slaying anything that moves is something that just never gets old but just as compelling as the gameplay is the presentation a much like Studio 51's other works it's all presented in cell-shaded fashion with some truly imaginative designs for art this is mainly reserved for the bosses that range from the grotesque to the absolutely absurd like running away from a giant dog to tackling flying monstrosities that managed to putt up a real fight on the whole short piece is a rather odd experience and if I'm being honest I would have preferred a bigger emphasis on gameplay rather than the animations that make up the adventure as if it's just so damn good to work through each level it's not a deal breaker by any means but if you're not a fan of anime you might want to sit this one out foreign heart a former Aristocrat who is killed in action immediately after the game begins as he dress away from the world he's confronted by a mysterious woman who offers him a deal to save his life Leon's soul is one of those of his descendants are required to fulfill her plan for as long as it takes to be fulfilled and of course it's not exactly to the world's benefit while startup is a pretty cliche premise soon flavishes into a grand narrative that's filled with plenty of twists and turns as you make your way towards attempt but for as good as the story is thankfully the gameplay is just as compelling it's basically a turn-based strategy RPG with a huge emphasis on something known as Soul breeding which allows you to augment your characters by choosing who they marry over the course of several Generations this system has a good amount depth with who you choose to marry having an important effect on the weapons you can wield as well as the stats that you can allocate by far though the high point of record a bag arrest is its battle system which is largely split up into two separate phases the first is you being able to move and position your units across the grid-based battlefield and the second allowing you to engage with any enemies you've made come into contact with you've got a varied set of moves and special skills to carry out with the main focus being to land a series of combos in the hopes of breaking the enemy that leaves them open to huge amounts of damage when push comes to shove the myths of fantasy turn-based strategy and RPG dating is for sure an intriguing combination but it would have been nice to have seen this system further fleshed out and be less reliant on style and instead provide a bit more substance the battles more than make up for any shortcoming slope so if you're a fan of the genre I say there's plenty here to learn coming from the same company that brought us the likes of Odin sphere and muramasa Dragon's Crown is a sight-rolling beat-em-up with several RPG elements thrown in to help us Stand Out amongst the crowd the first thing many players will notice that undeniably gorgeous visuals that helped make up the world of the game the individual frames and movements of each character are drawn exceptionally well and each action you perform feels as natural and fluid as it should but for as good as the graphics are without just as exceptional gameplay to back it up it wouldn't mean a film and Dragon's Crown delivers on this front as well as with many Beauty Maps the gameplay is fast paced and has the potential to become chaotic when the screen starts to fill up with a near impossible amount of enemies and of course each character is noticeably different with their own attributes and ways of contributing to each fight so much so that playing as each is essential in order to find one that shares your style of play for as frantic as the gameplay you can become then stuck into the RPG aspects of the game can be just as rewarding naturally you'll find yourself in an experience and leveling course of the game and equipping your character with increasingly powerful items and weapons that you can find throughout each dungeon you'll also be able to learn new skills that either expand or entirely change the abilities of your characters and while it doesn't offer up as much customization as some other RPGs do it still allows you to modify your character's skills to fit your own preferences to a good degree if you're fond of classic arcade games then Dragon's Crown is definitely something worth picking up well that does it for another video keep an eye out for part 2 as

singularity is quite easily one of the most overlooked and underappreciated games on the ps3 it's essentially a first-person shooter that all revolves around the concept of time travel the story picks up on the tiny island of catholic 12 where a strange mineral known as e-99 is being discovered it's not long before it's being researched which ultimately ends in a disaster as you would expect other nations get wind of the accident and send a team of soldiers to investigate what went down this is where the player comes in and takes up the role of nafanio renko upon arriving it's clear that not everything is as it seems now i won't go into too much detail about the narrative as it's simply one of the best aspects of the adventure but thankfully the minutemen of gameplay is also up to the task a huge range of both weaponry and abilities litter the experience with each of them bringing something new to the table from standard revolvers and rifles to more impressive options such as the tmd it plays very much like the gravity gun from half-life and fits perfectly into the world of singularity by combining these abilities and gameplay it creates many unique scenarios that help the game shine i'm sure there's players out there that will completely write it off due to its reliance on the games that have inspired it but in reality it manages to forge its own path and ends up creating its own identity in the process this is one that i highly recommend when it comes to racial games the playstation 3 is no slouch with the likes of ridge racer 7 and gran turismo 6 the console is not short on quality races but one that managed to stand out amongst them was a little game known as split second velocity what made it unique was its setup instead of setting out as a driver and slowly adding to your collection of vehicles you take part in a sort of reality tv show and play the role of a contestant where the goal is to simply make it around the track without getting blown to smithereens the game is your typical arcade racer with a huge twist you blow stuff up to take over rivals out it's known as the power play mechanic and takes the form of a gauge that must be filled up by your reckless driving from drifting to drafting or catchment each contribute to the gauge and once it's full this is where you can start to manipulate the environment around you falling cranes to helicopters shooting up the road there's an insane amount of options that all create mayhem on the track of course the core gameplay is tight and responsive as well each car possesses its own unique traits that offer a real difference once in a race and as you would expect with any racer there's a ton of different modes to get stuck into from survival to time attack and of course the main attraction being the season mode that allows you to unlock several new vehicles and parts that can be used right across the game if you're looking for a fun balls to the wall racer split second velocity has got you covered the ps3 was home to a wide range of open world games but one that stood out amongst the sea of releases was the saboteur the most unique aspect was its setting with it all taking place in a german occupied paris with players assuming the role of sean devlin an irish mechanic turned street racer who ends up becoming part of the french resistance now the gameplay is structured like many open world games and sees you taking on a variety of missions from driving to infiltration or outright mayhem they all offer up a decent amount of variety and thanks to the range of weaponry and options at your disposal it never becomes a mundane effect now you may have noticed that several sections of the game are represented in black and white this aesthetic ties into the world map with several locations acting as towers once you take out the enemies that occupy these spaces a vibrant and lush wave of color encapsulates the environment and in my opinion offers a really nice way of communicating which parts of the map have yet to be opened up by the player overall the saboteur is quite easily one of the best open world games on the system it's nothing revolutionary and doesn't beat the likes of grandpa's auto or assassin's creed but what it sets out to do it more than succeeds tokyo jungle is one of those games that is quite divisive you're either going to love its take on a post human earth or absolutely loathe its gameplay and find fault with its premise i for one think tokyo jungle is a severely underrated game that deserved much more recognition than it received now it essentially has two different modes one being the story and the other known as survival the goal is to play as an animal and survive post-apocalyptic tokyo and see how many years your bloodline can survive this involves getting food avoiding predators and mating to continue on to the next generation depending on the animal you play as the gameplay can be quite different predators can hunt other animals and need meat to survive and can stealthily hunt by hiding in grass and sneaking up on their prey then delivering a quick kill shot or by running rampant attacking larger beasts or other predators as a herbivore you have to find plants to eat and avoid being attacked by other predators as you hunt your prey or reach your plants your food in the area will dwindle causing you to migrate across the map in search of more food which keeps the game interesting as the food hotspots vary when you play the adventure provides you with a tremendous amount of different animals to play as some are large and strong but require lots of food while lovers are small and frail but easy to escape predators and need very little to eat as i said you're either gonna live or hate it but for what tokyo jungle offers up it's something that i highly recommend 3d dark game heroes is a game that's clearly aimed at a specific audience nobody can deny that it's not the original legend of zelda with some even going as far to say it's a blatant ripoff and even though there may be some truth to that it's not necessarily a bad thing the first aspect to get out of the way are the incredible visuals as the title of the game itself indicates everything in the world is made up of 3d dots or cubes if you will it takes on a sort of retro feel as you make your way through each environment but at the same time there's a very high level of detail such as reflections which are beautifully crafted as well as a whole string of particle effects that light up the screen jumping into gameplay right at the start you get to create your own avatar with a surprising amount of variety being afforded to the player the narrative sees you setting out to obtain several items that were sealed away long ago but once again have been unleashed upon the kingdom and it's up to you to locate them and bring an end to the destruction that they have brought about now when it comes to combat your sword plays a huge role there's quite a few to earn or find throughout the journey which all possess a varying degree of power they each have several attributes including length spin special and strength with them all being able to be upgraded to add even more options to your assignment between side quests exploration events and minigames this game offers up quite a bit of replayability overall it takes a classic formula renews it and kicks new life into it it won't be for everyone but for those that it clicks with it'll be hard to pat down at first dark sector will likely seem like another run-of-the-mill third person shooter but hiding underneath is a truly competent and engaging adventure that manages to stand out amongst the similar games of this nature around the ps3 what makes the overall gameplay interesting is the inclusion of something known as the glaive system which serves as the main mechanic for players to utilize throughout the journey it's essentially a boomerang that mainly serves as a weapon but also plays the part in solving many distinct environmental puzzles combat relies upon the glaive as well as several firearms and hand-to-hand combat performing combos and utilizing each part of your inventory is the quickest way to handle enemies and once certain conditions have been met you'll be able to execute devastating special attacks that really help out in tight situations it all comes together to create a deeply satisfying system that manages to make each engagement one of the clear highlights of the experience if this one passed you by when it first released its distinctive take on the genre is something that should not be missed enslaved odyssey is a game that is unfortunately largely being forgotten about it released quite early during the generation and never really managed to create an impact the story is the journey of a young man who was well enslaved and you start off aboard a crashing ship trying to escape before the ship's final crash it's during this set piece that you run into a young woman tripp who soon becomes your companion on the journey the two work together to navigate the post-apocalyptic environment that throws many obstacles that the player to overcome largely thanks to the climbing system it's possible to navigate each location in a sort of uncharted fashion mixing this aspect of the gameplay with the pretty robust combat results in a challenging but rewarding loop that will keep even the most proficient of players on their toes what makes it even better is the inclusion of several rpg elements that give the player the opportunity to upgrade several aspects of their character both when it comes to offensive actions as well as defensive abilities that really come into play as the adventure unfolds overall enslaved odyssey offers up an engrossing journey that won't hit with everyone that plays it but in its own right it's something that is well and truly worth experiencing now leia has a sort of checkered history it was one of the most anticipated games for the ps3 but upon its release it was completely discarded due to several issues with the core gameplay at the time sony were pushing its then new gyro function of the dualshock 3 which became an integral part of the gameplay now i'll be the first to admit that it was a pretty bad call but thankfully the developers heard the cries of many and decided to update the game with traditional controls which completely changed the experience the narrative ceases being introduced to a kingdom which is torn between two separate beliefs the use of dragons as war machines has become the norm with the player filling the role of a knight that pilots one of these beasts as the story plays out you learn why the world is the way it is and what side is really the correct site now the gameplay is what really helps leia stand out from aerial battles to ground-based skirmishes there's plenty of variety when it comes to fulfilling your objective now there's only about 15 levels that make up the journey but each of them offer up something fresh for the player to take on it is quite short but it doesn't detract from the overall experience if you've got the patience to get used to the rather unorthodox control setter leia is well worth checking out dante's inferno is a hack and slash that weighs its inspiration on its sleeves the likes of rygar and god of war clearly inspired the developers behind it and as they say copying is the biggest form of flattery it's nowhere near on the level of the games that influence it but it still offers up a competent experience that fans of the genre will likely enjoy it sees you filling the role of dante as you set out to save your wife from the depths of hell the story has its highs and lows but mostly highs with the main story arc being fairly interesting as you'll get to see what exactly dante did in his past as well as all the various levels of hell and who resides there within gameplay is where dante's inferno really begins to shine as you would expect you have a selection of weapons at your side to help deal with the onslaught of hell's minions with the most prominent being a scythe as well as a cross attack that forms the basis of the combat the goal is to simply rack up combos with the more you hit dealing out the extra damage but perhaps the most interesting part of the gameplay is the fact that you can punish or absolve certain enemies you can do this when you put enough damage into them leading to a unique grab attack where you can choose to punish or absolve after you've made your choice you'll get either red or blue orbs which will then level up your unholy or holy paths respectively each new level that you obtain on these paths gives you access to new abilities that are completely unique to your choices this provides a nice amount of replay value as you can then get to play through the adventure again with a whole series of different abilities all in all dante's inferno is well worth playing resonance of fate is a jrpg that introduces players to a distorted version of the future it takes on a story of steampunk aspheta and was clearly developed with a western audience in mind now the story is one of the weaker aspects of the game and doesn't really offer anything groundbreaking for the three protagonists that make up the adventure each of them do offer their own advantages and uses throughout the journey though and this is mainly during battle these encounters are all based around modern guns and weaponry and blend real-time action and elements of turn-based combat to create something entirely unique the action takes place much like it would in a first person shooter however aiming is completely automatic and the way each battle plays out is all tied to player movement if you simply just stand still nothing will happen which does offer moments of down time in order to conjure up a strategy once you begin to move though so do the enemies and thanks to a wide array of abilities and options you'll never be at a loss as to what to do despite some distinct problems resonance of fate is undoubtedly one of the better console jrpgs of the generation sadly i cannot in good faith claim that it's an unrivaled masterpiece it is however a tremendously inventive game that made great strides in breaking jrpgs out of their established rut while still remaining true to their roots well that does it for today's video if you're not subscribed yet make sure to hit that button and help

### Transcript
ex troopers is a third-person shooter that is a spin-off of the often overlooked capcom series lost planet it sees you taken of the role of brent turner as he and his instructor travel to a distant planet but upon arrival they are ambushed and are forced to defend themselves which springs the adventure into motion and sees you traveling across the strange environment of the planet named eden 3. you're equipped with many ways in which to do this from dashing mechanics to grappling zip lines and jet packs that make surviving the harsh environment all the more manageable and much like lost planet you possess a primary and secondary weapon as well but it also takes some minor inspiration from devil may cry and allows you to juggle your opponents in the air with these firearms as well mixing together all of the tools at your disposal during combat is the real highlight of the experience and to complement all of this a pretty robust leveling up system is in place as well each time you down an enemy or complete an objective you'll receive experience points that can then be spent on gaining various improvements such as increased melee damage higher amounts of health than prolonged use of your jetpack on top of this the same attention to leveling up is also lent to armor and weapons as well by collecting various materials scattered around each environment or securing them from vendors it's possible to upgrade your equipment and ultimately become an unstoppable force although the language barrier can be a bit tricky at first it soon becomes easier for non-japanese speakers to make their way through the adventure and in my eyes it is well worth playing it for yourself the long-running initial d series has always been one of my go-to racing games extreme stage is largely based upon the arcade release but brings with it several tweaks and improvements that make it the best way to experience it now the game mode centers around street racing and the culture that surrounds it it allows the player to participate in a variety of modes that all offer unique takes on the concept with the main one being legend of the streets it's essentially a story mode that sees you taking part in several street races across japan and interacting with a wide range of interesting characters at the beginning you start out with a basic vehicle but will soon be unlocking a wide range of upgrades and accessories to tailor your car now one of the most important aspects of any racing game is the gameplay an initial d extreme stage does not disappoint but don't go into it expecting a hyper realistic take on the sport as it presents a much more accessible form of racing that is all based around drifting instead of precisely hitting each corner the handling of each car can be a bit weird at first but once you've spent some time with it you'll be roaring through the japanese countryside and hitting corners in style this one is a must if you've never got around to playing one extreme stage provides a good jumping on point for newcomers as well super robot wars is a turn-based tactical role-playing game it sees you taking command of various larger-than-life machines as you battle it out across a variety of locales now each encounter is presented on a grid-based system which allows the player to move around the field depending on the attributes associated with their machine a 10 are included as well that all bring their own unique abilities to the fight one aspect of combat that makes a return from previous entries is the twin battle system that grants the player the ability to essentially combine two separate units that brings with it a whole range of benefits from increased health to hits that grant more damage it's a neat little system that can provide a means in which to save your ass when things are getting tight but it's not the only mechanic that makes an appearance there are several skills which can be unlocked and equipped throughout the duration of the campaign each pilot has several slots that can eventually be filled with these abilities that range from devastating finishing moves to more defensive maneuvers that can at times mean the difference between victory or defeat but the most notable aspect of super robot wars have to be the visuals on the field it's a pretty simple affair but as soon as you attack each engagement fills the screen with incredibly detailed sprites and animations that bring a real weight to the on-screen action if you're at all fond of tactical rpgs super robot wars is truly worth giving a go based on the manga of the same name the fighting is a third person boxer that closely follows the events of the story and allows the player to experience it in a new way you take up the fight to zippo and make your way through a surprisingly deep campaign mode that sees you taking on a huge range of fighters and building your abilities along the way as you would expect each fighter is unique with them all having their own distinct styles and ways of dealing with everything you throw at them which all comes together in some truly explosive matches once out in the ring combos play a huge role in maintaining your momentum in each fight for each hit you land your game progressions when locking your finisher that when executed at the right time will see your opponent hit the mat in seconds now one of the main aspects that really impressed me was playing with the visuals the cel-shaded aesthetic really helps the on-screen action feel like a true extension of the manga and is bound to satisfy fans of the source material by no means is it the most intricate or accurate take on boxing but the fighting still provides one of the most engaging and rewarding takes on the sport to date so if you're on the lookout for something fun and unique to pass the time with or are fond of the manga and want to give it a go the fighting will not disappoint starting out life on the playstation 2 the hack series became well known for its blend of unique rpg elements and narrative that made it stand out amongst the variety of rpgs on the system as with most successful franchises a selection of spin-offs usually materialize and the hack series is no exception pack versus is essentially a fighting game that sees various characters from the franchise coming together to battle it out and although there's not that much in the way of story while it lacks in narrative it more than makes up for in gameplay now there are eight fighters in total that all naturally possess a selection of basic attacks as well as unique special moves that all bring something different to the table giving each of them a go is essential to find a fighter that suits your style and play best much like other fighters you'll find that each fight also revolves around building up a gauge in order to perform extremely powerful moves in hack faces these moves are called ultimate attacks and as you take damage or successfully land hits the bar will slowly rise and eventually grant you the ability to execute your character's skill as you would expect they are a real spectacle and light up the screen in style overall hack vs is a competent fighting game by no means is it the most technical fighter on the system but for those looking for a solid and well-rounded experience it's definitely worth a shot the playstation 3 is no stranger to quality fighting games but one that often gets overlooked due to it never leaving japan is phantom breaker extra it serves as an enhanced version of the original and includes several tweaks improvements and extra content that make it the definitive vision of the game the story sees a mysterious entity known as phantom appearing in tokyo an offering to grant the wish of chosen ones who participate in a fighting tournament there are 18 in total and as you would expect they all take on their own style so taking your time and experimenting with each is a good idea to figure out which one is for you as they all likely differ from one another but what makes them stand out are their unique special skills stringing them together and performing combos is the surefire way of securing victory and soon becomes the best part of the game naturally as you deal damage you contribute to a gauge that then allows you to perform a finisher these abilities fill the screen and adorn it with wonderfully detailed sprites that add a real charm to the game once you're done with the story several modes are included as well from your standard arcade to training and verses that add a nice touch of longevity to the experience so if you've exhausted the usual suspects on the system and are looking for a new fighting game to get into phantom breaker extra is a great option i've always been a huge fan of the yakuza series ever since its humble beginnings on the playstation 2 each game has continued to refine and improve what makes the series so great and has no doubt contributed to its success a spin-off known as kanzan that takes the adventure into the past is one of the most intriguing and exciting takes on the series it sees you taken on the role of miyamoto masashi a bodyguard who retreated into a quiet life after suffering a huge defeat but it isn't long until you are once again plunged into the criminal underworld of the city and take on a hit that sparks the adventure like previous entries in the franchise the gameplay is largely split into two separate styles the first sees you exploring the city of kyoto and interacting with the impressive amount of npcs with the second bm combat that is made up of four elements you have basic melee one blade two and two handed blades each of these fighting styles have their place and come into play depending on how many enemies you are presented with the combat soon becomes the real star of the show and provides some of the most memorable moments of the experience now kensing has unfortunately never made it west but with support from the game's producer and many of the fans as well it looks like it may soon become a real possibility that having to settle for the japanese version will soon be a thing of the past wangan midnight is based on the manga series of the same name and is developed by genku the developers responsible for the tokyo extreme racer series and shares much in common with those titles like most racing games several modes make the cut but the most prominent being the story mode it follows the events of the manga and sees you taking the main character through a series of challenges set across the shuto expressway obviously it's quite hard to appreciate it as it's all presented in japanese but thankfully it's not the only mode that makes the cut you have time attack free run maximum speed and survival to make up for it now matching the sheer variety of game modes of cars that can be used on the road all of them are officially licensed models from the likes of nissan toyota and mitsubishi that are all beholden to something known as the card system these cards are essentially used to tune each vehicle from the body engine types and even appearance that makes unlocking all 128 of them essential to see everything that the game has to offer and it won't be easy as an extreme amount of challenges present in one gun midnight that is sure to test even the most proficient of racing players a special note of the visuals with it being one of the select playstation 3 games to run natively at 1080p and it really shows making it one of the better looking games on the system if you're a serious fan of racing you should not pass this one up a ton of incredible gundam games have released for the playstation 3 over the years but one that truly deserves your attention is extreme vs full boost it shares much in common with the likes of virtual on and presents a mech-based action game that fans of the anime can enjoy as you would expect a generous amount of gundams make the cut that all come with their own unique arsenal of weapons and abilities that make dealing with the onslaught of enemies all the more manageable especially some of the bosses that in my opinion are the real highlight of the game some of them fill the entire screen and require real strategy in order to defeat because of this you'll constantly find yourself swapping in and out of different setups that promotes trying everything the game has to offer now fans of the series will feel right at home and although at first it can be quite tricky for non-japanese speakers to follow the story the minute to minute gameplay more than makes up for it visually extreme vs full boost is quite impressive the fast areas allow you to freely navigate and unleash devastating but eye-pleasing abilities that fill the screen with color and although the game is prone to a few frame rate tips once the action heats up it's nothing that truly takes away from the experience now for non-japanese speakers several guides on the internet can point you in the right direction especially when it comes to navigating menus and upgrading machines it can be quite tax heavy so i'd highly recommend seeking them out if you decide to pick this one up macros 30 is loosely based on the macros anime and sees players jumping into a huge array of machines that all have the ability to transform into several states those being fighter jets and incredibly powerful land-based robots that grant you a whole range of abilities in which to take on the mission-based adventure as you would expect each machine can be fully customized with a whole host of weapon loadouts that allow you to cater each to your specific style of play may that be up close and personal or attacking from a distance there's a generous amount of options that facilitate each way in which to approach each mission on top of this several character specific abilities are included that manage to help out during the more intense situations you'll find yourself encountering once out on the field the controls are tight and responsive allowing you to engage each enemy with confidence and visually the game is absolutely stunning it really shows what the playstation 3 was capable of when in the hands of the right developers each machine is intricately detailed as well as the vast landscapes they occupy if this one passed you by now would be the perfect time to jump in and give it a go for yourself well that does it for today's video don't forget to hit subscribe and follow me on all of the socials

God of War is always impressed when it comes to presentation and after squeezing every last ounce of power out of the PlayStation 2 it SE would hit the PlayStation 3 and produce one of the finest looking games of its generation picking up right after the events of the second game you once again step into the role of Kratos as you take the fight to the gods themselves and within seconds of beginning you thrown straight into the action at its core it's extremely similar to the two previous games with Kratos being the God of War you've got plenty of available attacks and new weapons to find throughout the adventure now the best way to describe it would be that it's the perfect blend of fighting platforming and puzzle solving and with the combat being fast furious and brutal you'll have no problem racking up high combos which really help you get creative with your approach from melee attacks to Magic and QuickTime finishes it's an absolute Gore Fest which is only bolstered by The Game's incredible art design and attention to detail first off kattos himself is mely rendered from his facial expressions to the animation of his moves it's clear a lot of care went into realizing this version of him and the same can be said about the range of different enemies and bosses that make up some of the best set pieces in the series by far of course the various locations that make up the game as well are beautifully real realized from the heights of Mount Olympus to the fiery depths of the underworld and every new environment you encounter comes along with a sense of grandeur you don't often find with similar games of its kind so if you never got around to playing it it's just as enjoyable now as it was all those years ago joury was one of the most unique games I ever hit the PlayStation 3 and much like his name suggest is about traveling from A to B with much more of a focus on the experience between those two points at the beginning you're literally thrown into the deep end with no clear objectives or information about what to do and I feel this aspect of the game will really help immerse you in the adventure as you slowly begin to figure out the several ways you can reach the ominous Mountain that forever lingers in the distance now the simple control scheme makes Journey incredibly easy to interact with and the fact that sliding around in the sand and floating around in midair is such a joyful experience means it's not only easy to interact with but ahe of a lot of fun to play it goes without saying that graphics and music are a huge importance in Journey and it's extremely impressive visually both technically and artistically from the vast sundrenched desert to The Bleak solemn and bitter cold Mountain it's impossible not to feel the need to stop every now and then so you can pan your camera around and take it all in Journey is also crammed full of needle or visual effects that Aid in boosting the amount of emosion the game has to offer by walking around in the sand you'll leave little trails and kick sand particles about that glisten in the Sun and it's these elements that make the world feel like a believable space in which to explore journey is a game that nearly anyone can enjoy that delivers an emotional and Unforgettable Adventure so if this is one game you never got round to it's definitely something that's worth taken the time to play gr zero served as the introduction to metal Gus a 5 and although the phantom pain is objectively the better game in terms of content and scope I feel that it's L was a much more concise and measured experience that delivered a far more traditional take on the Metal Gear series set after the events of Peace Walker this is Big Boss being called to a black site known as Camp Mega which is rumored to be holding his former comrades Chico and P who have been subjected to Unthinkable amounts of torture in terms of gameplay this is Metal Gear at its best and quite frankly the Pinnacle of action stealth that affords the player an endless amount of ways to approach each of the game's different missions may that be the quiet and calculated path that relies upon your tranquilizer and outwitting the guards with various different items to the more action focused with one of the many different weapons you can unlock like machine guns C4 rocket launchers and sniper rifles now when it comes to visuals ground zeros on the PlayStation 3 was a real Testament to the power of the console and the fox engine itself even though it's a clearly dialed back when compared to its PS4 and PC counterparts with a lot less foliage shorter draw distances and a lower resolution it's still an impressive achievement that runs at 720 and hits a respectable 30 FPS the amount of detail in the game is simply staggering may that be the environment itself the weather effects and lighting that all come together to create an incredible atmosphere in the camp which makes for a truly immersive albeit short game if you only ever played the phantom pain then you owe it to yourself to check round zeros out and with it now being readily available for a cheap price it's well worth it from software have become one of my favorite developers with many incredible games under their belt that I'm still discovering to this day one of them is Gundam unicorn that retells the story of the anime and throws you into one of several different mecs as you use their unique abilities to tackle the series of battles as you would expect there's a huge amount of customization that the player gets to play around with and at the end of each Mission you're rewarded a certain amount of tuneup points that can be spent on various upgrades may that be different weapons armor or skills that all mix up the gameplay when out in the field speaking of gameplay the controls can be a bit overwhelming at first and maneuvering the huge Macs will definitely take some time to get used to but once it all clicks it's one of the most visceral and engaging Mac games of all time it really preserves the feeling of speed that fans of the source material will be familiar with and with the amount of actions you can perform it honestly feels like one of the most authentic takes on the franchise now visually Gundam unicorn is one of the PlayStation 3 most gorgeous games and like I've already mentioned that's largely due to the incredible speed that the action plays out presented it's 60 FPS it's a really smooth experience which is only bolstered by the insane amount of detail that each Mech comes along with it's clear to see that a lot of love went into recreating each of the suits of weapons and when you couple this with the insane amount of effects that light up the screen during combat each fight becomes a true spectacle if you enjoy the franchise or just m games in general then Gundam unicorn will right up your street rain is by far one of the most overlooked games on the PlayStation 3 and it's easy to understand why is it never received a physical release in the west and would instead be tied to the PlayStation Store indefinitely you take on the role of a young boy who spots mysterious girl in the rain she runs from a terrifying monster prompting him to find her and ultimately bring her to safety I don't want to spoil too much as the story is easily one of my favorite parts of the experience so I'll leave leave it up to you to discover if you decide to give it a go now one of the first things that will strike anyone who plays it are the completely Unique Mechanics that the game deploys which are all built around the rain itself as the boy begins to explore the city you'll realize that you're nothing without the rain and your body disappears upon finding shelter the various monsters that lur through the empty streets are also Afflicted with the same condition as you and it all soon becomes a game of hide and seek as you swiftly but quietly move through the Alleyways and Dodge in and out of the safety of cover from the rain now in terms of presentation rain may not be one of the most technically impressive games you can find on the console but when it comes to its art design this is where the game truly begins to shine the desolate beauty of the abandoned city you explore is enhanced by the subdued piano score which offers subtle background texture without overpowering the other elements all of the parts that make up the game fit together perfectly and as the narrative builds to a suspenseful climax it becomes utterly captivating overall if you're looking for an Unforgettable Adventure then rain is definitely a game worth considering rid racer has long been one of my favorite racing series ever since being introduced to the first game on the PS1 fast forward a few years and it would appear on the PlayStation 3 is a launch title that took full advantage of the extra power the console provided by presenting the experience in a native 1080p resolution all the while locking the racing at 60 FPS as many will know the series is much more of an arcade racer instead of focusing on the hyper realism you find in hits like Gran Turismo and it puts a huge emphasis upon drifting and the use of nitro in order to get around the track in the fastest time possible of course you can expect to take part in one of many different modes with the most challenging being the championship that sees you traveling across the world and fighting several Rivals for the number one spot making this all the more enjoyable is the incredible selection of cars as well as parts that can be earned over the course of the Season that all offer a noticeable advantage on the track may that be engine upgrades or different types of nitrous there's plenty to play around with that's dealt out at a nice pace so much so that it feels that the game is constantly throwing new things your way which really helps it from becoming stale now visually Rd racer 7 looks incredible even to this day and that's got a lot to do with the crisp resolution and solid frame rate but also the design of each track and car may that be the bustling cities that you race through with break neck speeds the calm and beautiful Countryside that sees the sun slowly setting behind you or the reflection of tunnel lights that Cascade off the body of your car as you manage to reach your top speed in short it's a beautiful game and of course there were better looking options out there but for a launch title Ridge Racer 7 really hit home just how powerful the PlayStation 3 was ever since its first release on the PlayStation and Sega Saturn the dad of Life Series has always been at the Forefront when it comes to visuals and the favorite eration is no exception taking a couple of cues from Dimensions that appeared on the 3DS the game does away with the traditional arcade mode and instead presents a full-fledged story for the player to dive into here you move from character to character and slowly unravel the plot that manages to convey a pretty decent story from start to end in terms of gameplay it's the same 3D based fighter anyone familiar with the series will know and love with all of the characters coming along with their own unique move sets and style as well as your basic hits like punch es kicks and froze you also get to perform special moves known as power blows and critical bursts these abilities have the potential to flip the outcome of a fight and even though they require quick reflexes once you master it you'll be pulling them off left and right when it comes to Graphics just like the games before it dat Live 5 is a truly graphically impressive experience the character models are by far the best aspect of the visual makeup with plenty of detail being afforded to each of them and it's the little details that really shine may that be the way their hair and clothing realistically reacts to their movement or the several facial expressions that accompany their attacks of course the stages that these fights play out on are just as impressive and range from temples to cities and huge stadiums with plenty of background details that bring life to each and every one of them although it's not exactly the best fighting game you can find on the PS3 D Life 5 is easily one of the best looking ever since the first game on the PlayStation 2 C Mari has really stood out thanks to its unique gameplay and quirky style that it can happily call its own the player takes on the part of a young prince who's looking to help the king return the cosmos to its former glory and it's no easy task but by using your Katamari which is essentially a ball capable of sticking and picking up any object smaller than itself it'll slowly grow as you navigate one of the many levels and add to its size and weight ultimately being turned into a new star in the night sky if you complete the stage within the given time time limit it's a simple concept but it's a lot harder than it initially sounds as your objectives change from stage to Stage some see you having to pick up items based on their monetary value while another might force you to only grab hot items to increase the heat of your Katamari what really helps the game though is the colorful art style that permeates throughout every aspect of the Experience One quite clever graphical gimmick is that how some stages start out as a black and white outline of the environment and as you roll over objects and get larger more and more of it turns into color it's a really nice touch and with the sheer amount of objects you can interact with it looks absolutely incredible in motion on top of this it's all rendered in 1080P and while the frame rate can be a bit on the slow side with it occasionally dipping below 30 FPS is kind of understandable with the amount that goes on during each run though far from a deep and complex puzzle game catari forever still offers a great time and with its infectious soundtrack lovable characters and art style it's quite hard to put down once you start rolling there's no denying that Final Fantasy 1 was a bit of a train rank I no that prompted Square to try and Salvage what they could by producing two sequels with Lightning Returns picking up centuries after the second game's ending you wake to learn that the world is going to end in 13 days and you make a deal with the God of Light to become his servant and rid the Earth of the darkness that plagues it and in return you and your family's freedom is yours this countdown plays into nearly every aspect of the game that serves as a real driving force and a constant reminder of the dire state of the world in addition to the main quest there's over 60 side missions to take on as well that offer a nice variety and change of pace to help keep the game feeling fresh over the course of its near 30-hour run time as you would expect battles also play a huge role with the system feeling like a cross between Final Fantasy 10 and Crisis Core where you can unleash realtime attacks using the face buttons and wait on the ATB bar to unleash more powerful abil ities now for all of 13's problems the one thing that the game had going for it was its presentation and that aspect is carried on here quite well the main character and major supporting characters are beautifully animated and the different gaps lightning can wear all feel unique and detail this carries over to the areas you explore from the dense forests to Grand cities and deserts that litter the landscape which provide an impressive backdrop for all of the action to play out in even though it's not exactly a traditional entry in the series Lightning Returns is the better one out of the 13 series and while it won't be for everyone it definitely brought the trilogy to a good close after the absolute mess that was Aliens colonial Marines a lot was riding on isolation to deliver and taking a brief glance at some of the reviews at the time of its release you'd be forgiven thinking that it didn't live up to the expectations but I for one truly enjoyed the more basic and old school approach that the game took which resulted in it being one of the final survival Horrors in recent memory the game sees you picking up the role of Ellen Ripley's daughter Amanda who's on her way to a space station that's said to house the black box of the Nostromo and possibly some answers as to what happened to her missing mother gam play sees it all playing out from a first Pi perspective as you explore the space station and weave in and out of the shadows in the hopes of evading a xenomorph that's running loose on the ship ammo and weapons are really scarce and with the game's combat being purposefully quite hard it really helps make you feel that you could die at any second now when it comes to the game's visuals it's really hard to understand how they even got this up and running on the hardware and sure several Corners have been cut in order to do so but the level of detail is simply stunning when compared to its next gen counterparts the space station itself feels like it's being pulled straight out of the films and recreates the atmosphere of them perfectly the various effects such as the lighting and shadows all work together to make each and every room you explore come along with a severe sense of Dr that really amps up the scares and pulls you into the world even further although the game won't be for everyone mainly due to its mixture of both new and old style of survival Horrors any fan of the franchise will find something here to love well that does it for another video don't forget to subscribe and hit that Bell to get notified

taken place in the fictional realm of thought Nia it is the players role as the hero to rid the land of a great evil which is responsible for casting a devastating plague upon its citizens at the beginning of the adventure that game presents you with a generous amount of options in which to create your own character to occupy the world and follow you on your journey now the gameplay shares many similarities with the role-playing games of old such as early Zelda and Dragon Quest titles they revolves around exploring the world and its many dungeons as you utilize various items such as lanterns bows and boomerangs to overcome enemies as well as some truly head-scratching puzzles but one of the main highlights is the player's sword that can grow to an immense size upon being swung image taken our enemies an absolute breeze and on top of this the sword can be fully customized and upgraded throughout the course of the adventure to land me from more power and abilities to the heroes if you've missed this one when it released if you miss this one upon its release now is the perfect time to add this little jam to your library taking place in world war 2 against the backdrop of a Nazi occupied Paris the saboteur introduces the player to a resistance fighter known as Sean who's intent on liberating the city from the clutches of evil now the gameplay takes many cues from the likes of Assassin's Creed such as free climbing mechanics that make exploring the environment enjoyable as well as opening up many possibilities in which to take on enemies it mainly focuses upon stuff by rewarding the player with many incentives to do so it is easily the most effective way of which to succeed but a diverse set of weaponry is also available and unlockable throughout the course of the experience allowing those who prefer a more hands-on approach to instantly feel right at home as well so if you're looking for a competent adventure to get stuck into look no further than the saboteur the club centers around the simple concept a sinister group operates an underground club and forces people into the participation of a survival of the fittest competition and what is essentially an arena-style shooter with racing elements on top I know it sounds a bit weird and it fair seems like an odd mix but once you get some time a bit soon all begins to make sense there are several characters for the player to take into the arena eight in total that all differ from each other as well as possessing slightly different attributes and with five separate types of events to take part in there is plenty to get stuck into the main aspect of the game is centered around the scoring system where each consecutive kill that is executed ghana's a higher multiplier for the player the less time it takes for you to move on to your next kill increases the amount your score is multiplied by it it's a real blast and to top it all off there is a pretty robust multiplayer component that caters to local as well as on my plate which in all honesty is where the experience truly shines Dark Sector at first seems like a never run-of-the-mill third-person shooter but hiding underneath is a genuinely competent experience that manages to stand out from the crowd now what makes the gameplay interesting is the inclusion of the glaive system which serves as the main mechanic players take advantage of throughout the experience it takes the form of a weapon which is essentially a boomerang and empowers the player with the ability to take on enemies as well as solve several environmental puzzles the combat system is relatively straightforward with a few button presses resulting in devastating combos and once certain conditions are met a special takedown can be performed which can help in really tight situations as well as the boomerang firearms are also available to the player which really helped out such as when waiting for the boomerang to return or just releasing a volley of attacks it is a deeply satisfying system which manages to keep the combat feeling fresh if this one passed you by it is also available on various other consoles so if you've yet to give it a go there are many options available if you do decide to play hard corpse uprising is a runnin gun shooter the harkens back to the golden years of the genre taken place within the contour universe the experience serves as a spin-off to the original line of games in the series the gameplay is comprised of two separate modes known as Arcade and horizon as you would expect the arcade mode is pretty straight forward with it requiring the player to overcome several stages with a limited amount of life and weaponry but the real meat and potatoes of the experience lies in the rising mode which tasks the player with accumulated points throughout each of the stages which can then be spent on a wide array of upgrades for both your weaponry and abilities from standard rifles and machine guns all the way to rocket launchers even lasers and swords there is a huge variety to be found within the gameplay especially when dealing with the on-screen enemies that at times can be truly overwhelming resulting in an experience that is not only challenging but completely satisfying upon mastering its momentum over gameplay starting out life on the PlayStation 2 the katamari series is continued to evolve it's relatively simple premise to this day for many katamari fans the PlayStation 3 release represents one of the high points of the franchise and quite rightly so as mentioned the premise is incredibly simple with the objective revolving around collecting as much junk as possible that is scattered throughout each stage the experience absolutely loses charm both the visuals and sounds come together in perfect harmony which only helps further push the light-hearted nature of the proceedings and with all the 34 stages the best stuff into as well as a pretty neat multiplayer option there is hours upon hours of fun to be had with Katamari forever players assume the role of Travis touchdown a rather charismatic character task we've taken out 10 of the world's most renowned assassins the bulk of the experience revolves around this goal but to help break things up there are several side quests that reward the player with extra weapons as well as cosmetic upgrades that allow you to customize Travis to your liking gameplay wise heroes paradise truly shines obviously the control scheme differs quite significantly when compared to the original due to the unique setup of the Nintendo Wii but if I'm honest it feels more at home on a traditional controller every swim and jump feels completely natural and when coupled with the visual upgrades it truly makes the PlayStation 3 version the definitive way to experience an unforgettable adventure folklore is essentially an action RPG that revolves around two main protagonists it takes place in the present day after the two characters experience separate events that compel them to visit a mysterious village an island known as duty it doesn't take long for them to realize everything is not as it seems before they are plunged into a separate reality that lends much inspiration from Celtic myths you have the choice of choosing between the two characters which both have unique journeys that promote a second playthrough in order to see everything the experience has to offer but where folklore truly shines his repentance gratefully with most enemies you encounter being able to be absorbed upon defeating them is supreme you need mechanic which lends the experience an extra layer of strategy as only four can be mapped at one time with several being either weak or more effective against others now opponents release both Lord didn't manage to find it to be and as a consequence it went missed by many so if you haven't tried it out it really would make a worthy addition to your collection Dragon's Dogma sees the player taken up the role of a customizable protagonist on an adventure to bring down a great dragon known as grigory the gameplay takes the form of a hack and slash with its combat system at first seeming quite basic in its execution but it soon becomes apparent that it offers a deeper experience that allows players to execute more technical attacks the player is also accompanied by several companions known as pawns which help deal of damage to enemies whilst battered him as well as hints and tips when exploring and taken on quests in the world players can choose from several types of classes for their protagonist ranging from arches assassins sorcerers and many more that all offer their own distinct abilities and advantages when taken on quests and objectives were in the world Dragon's Dogma received an updated release which is now available for the ps4 Xbox one and Nintendo switch so if you've moved on from the PlayStation 3 and fancy jumping in to give it a go you can so on the current generation of consoles as well Deadly Premonition saw several reworks before its eventual release in 2010 today we're talking about the director's cut which offers a few upgrades over the original vision such as improved controls and visuals which may be easier to recommend in the original now the experience is broken up into a series of quests that reward the player with Indian currency that can then be spent on various day-to-day items and essential resources such as fuel every aspect that deadly premonition is littered with this kind of realism such as having to keep yourself fed clean and even sleep for regular intervals that all impacts your performance as well as the rewards you receive upon completing tasks during specific portions of the experience combat scenarios play out in a variety of ways one of these being to utilize the range of melee weapons and firearms which are available to the player or to simply hold your breath and avoid enemies in order to survive each encounter each weapon has a finite lifespan which adds a sense of risk vs.

reward to the combat where in most instances it is much better to stay in the shadows than letting yourself be known Deadly Premonition is an unforgettable adventure I'm sure you will not be disappointed

foreign starting our life on the PlayStation 2 the Yakuza series is consistently Innovative and managed to stay relevant right up until this day there's been many sequels and spin-offs that help solidify the franchise's success but one lesser known entry that deserves way more attention than a God is your Cruiser dead salt it's a huge departure from the usual formula you'd expect that instead takes on the form of a sort of arcade shooter it's not only the gameplay that's different however the story is also a change from what the games are known for it revolves around four separate chapters that each star a specific character fans will know and love each chapter sees you fighting through wave after wave of enemies as you hope to eventually reach the city limits and ultimately your safety as you would expect you're given a wide range of Weaponry in order to achieve this goal may be a standard pistol or a dual wielding shotguns there's a ton of ways to approach each swarm of zombies you'll need to utilize all of the options at your disposal is the hordes of Relentless and pose a meaningful threat as you make your way through the adventure the spice fans up even further there's also the inclusion and special abilities let's see teaming up with a partner to score some serious damage there's quite a few of them for each character such as throwing several grenades of the enemy and shooting them just as they land each of them are a real spectacle and managed to add a distinct amount of style to the combat that helps it flow even better to top all of this off you've also got the inclusion in several minigames like Yakuza is well known for such as karaoke or darts to help mix up the gameplay even further by providing a few engaging ways to pass the time if you're a fan of the series this one is a no-brainer and likewise for those who enjoy arcade Shooters there is plenty to love 3D dog game he rose is a unique action adventure that takes a huge inspiration for likes of Zelda specifically the first game of the NES where there was a real focus on open environments that moved from screen to screen even the story shares some similarities as it's set up that long ago the sages used their power to seal away of great evil now in the present evil has returned it's up to you to obtain that power of banquet ship the basic structure of the gameplay sees you exploring the world map solving dungeons to recover orbs of power and gain the equippable items along the way that let you access new areas and perform new moves budget plays a somewhat bigger role and is more involving than most Zelda games as opposed to depleting it by the lighter in a lantern or charger in a Spin Attack you consume it by activating spells that you learn throughout the game there are several of them and unlike in some games most of them are absolutely required to progress and the ones that aren't incredibly useful when used strategically you might do damage to enemies freeze an area or slow down time which all come in hand handy against the surprisingly challenging white supposit how visually is the title of game itself in place the game's Graphics are all composed of 3D dots the idea being to take the pixelated look of classic NES games and updating it and it was sort of 3D version you'll find that it is also a lot of charm to be found not to mention a character editor and we're not talking about selecting from a set of designs tweaking them you get to create your entire character out little blocks in 3D from the ground up including colors different poses you name it all in all 3D job Game Heroes flawlessly takes an old games design and reduce it this one is well worth picking up if you can find it on the cheap for long time fans of the channel you'll likely already be aware of my unhealthy obsession with Ridge Racer while it's nowhere near the best racing game series you'll find on the PS3 is definitely one of the most enjoyable due to its easy pickup and play Arcade nature is with most racing games that made meat and potatoes of the game lies in the championship mode and here you are met with a series of tracks to race around them that whilst in the new cars and parts along the way this is one of the finest aspects of the game as it provides a deep system for car fans to fine-tune their car and take advantage of the several benefits they offer it's not only faster speeds but you can also earn AIDs that can help out such as bumpy rental cars resulting in taking less per hit the true star of the show however is the gameplay itself its arcade approach opens it up to players of all ages and skill levels but at the same time offers up a drifting system That's essential to master in order to complete some of the more challenging races to gain Frozen you've drifting through a tight Corner as the music blasts and the announcer everyone is a feeling that just never got sold once we've got it down adding to the racing is the Nitro system which intricately ties into the upgrade option shall unlock along the way there's several types available with the most common being a gauge that is made up of 3D section as you drift around each course the gauge slowly Rises and allows you to find this hyper one part or your whole gauge as you please there's several variations on this that give it different effects such as being able to build the gauge quickly while offering faster speeds for fewer sections of the bar overall Ridge Racer 7 is by no means the best racing game you'll find on the PlayStation 3 but with its style gameplay impressive visuals and Battery smooth performance is one that deserves a look especially for fans of the series and if the genre is full PlayStation 3 had a huge selection solid RPGs to play but one that never truly received the attention it deserved has to be full plot this game's story is one of mystery the main characters Alan and cleats are both brought to the strange town that do them for different reasons by and large the gameplay is split into two different types with folklore's seven chapters with each of the protagonists in the beginning of a chapter you will sniff up Clues and suit answers for our durian Village and when Nikon shall be transported to a realm of The Surreal never will where you must fight your way through to the people levels boss in these Realms your character will encounter folks you must battle them and discover their group points and there's about a hundred of these beasts each of them all requiring a different approach once you've defeated a folk you can absorb its soul and doing so Grant you their power to wield and Southern clothes I love folklore's story but I think my favorite part of the game is using provokes in battle there is so many of them and they are each so different you get to choose which ones you want to use by assigning them to the base buttons and with a simple tap friendly men to the field they're from folks have specific elements they exhibit via bundle wind or fire for example and certain creatures are susceptible to certain elements and abused robbers this adds a ton of strategy to even the most mundane of Campus which helps to come back itself overall folklore is a game with an intriguing and mysterious story along with solid and fluent template the graphics are extremely artistic and easy on the ice and it has enough extra content to keep you playing quite some time to cope Tales of exilia introduces players to the Lush floating world of Reyes maxia a world made up of two states who find themselves on the Brentwood wall the populace of the world is full of people that rely on the power of spirits to use everyday Goods whether it be for light or activating Machinery so naturally they play a major role in the story which sees you taking up the role of one of two characters either Jude or Miller both tell what is essentially the same story but with a few deviations that promotes an extra playthrough once you're done when it comes to gameplay those familiar with the series will know the tales of franchise Prides itself on its action-based Combat gameplay like many other RPGs battles begin when the player character touches an enemy roaming around on the map and shifts to a circle Arena hitting a party of up to four characters against their opponents combat consists of stringing together combos using the x button for quick TP generating attacks and the circle button for classes special attacks known as Arts that consume TP this system works perfectly and incentivizes the required to keep up the pressure during combat which results in some truly exhilarating battles if xylia was the first Tales game to actually be made for the Playstation 3 and unfortunately it shows it just doesn't stand technically the main Cooperative texture started just woefully and detailed than just flat out playing at times but on the other hand the artistic vision of the game more than bets up the shortcomings using an oil painting style with Dave's World almost seems like a painting on the wall that is expertly crafted each local feels unique whether you visit one of the many cities or the snowy recesses of the highest peak and thankfully the performance remains solid at 60 frames per second during fights and in all honesty this is where the game truly comes into its own while it has a few issues Tales of Xillia is one of the better Tales games out there a great RPG in general if you like jrpgs and have a PlayStation 3 I strongly recommend giving this game a try after the huge success of the first game the sequel to implements was a polygon conclusion and released two years later he once again saw players jumping into the shoes of Cole McGrath he loses a long-anticipated battle with his greatest enemy the Beast and subsequently escapes to the newly introduced Locale of numerate an elastic attempt to boost its powers what's more is that the story takes some surprise and twists and turns the perfectly progress depending on the choices you've made will lead to completely different endings while being an open world game only playing on the story missions will allow you to progress towards the conclusion but there are thousands of side missions to do and builds to Flat doing all of these things is very fun thanks to the various and Visually stimulated superpowers of Cole's disposal Paul's Amplified body allows him to shoot lots of electricity out of his hands and enemies toss electric grenades for wide range damage blew people away with his stunning blasts that will also reflect Rockets a much much more aside from combat elements the biggest part of Infamous 2 is exploration Uber Ray is big but Cole has ways to get around quickly you can slide down telephone wires to quickly move from one place to the max or grab one of the charged vertical poles and Cole will launch himself High into the air it feels incredibly smooth just bolting around the city which helps them flow quite nicely finally the biggest aspect of the game is the karma system in almost every situation you have a choice do you assume the role of hero to a desperate City or do you live up to your name as a demon colon locks his best powers while becoming either a hero or an Infamous villain it's Saving Grace though is that the story plays out quite differently and the game gives you plenty of incentives to complete it twice such as trophies and hard difficulty Infamous 2 proves itself is an excellent sequence with already unique game fun combat and engaging Story full art style beautiful soundtrack and tons to do made this a worthwhile ride everyone should take Puppeteer is a spectacular platforming experience for the PlayStation 3.

unfortunately it got overlooked by many it's a shame too because it is truly one of the most inventive enjoyable and totally original side scrollers of all time developed by Japan Studio it's a sort of throwback to the platform as a whole such as Clockwork Knighton for Noah and the bizarre story really sets the stage quite literally for an unforgettable and dramatic Adventure it all kicks off with the main villain known as the bear King who kidnaps a boy named kritaru ultimately turning him into a wooden puppet and take him his head katara's quest to find his head and escaped the grasp of the bacon takes place on a stage of a puppet show complete with mechanical sets curtains and a visual audience as with most Platformers the game is split up into a series of levels that slowly ramp up the difficulty the Fairview regrets but kataru's got a few tricks up his sleeve to help even the odds the main one being a pair of scissors that you can use to attack enemies and essentially flip through the air while cousin items or enemies made of fabric or paper for cutting connected some guy used to and is honestly unlike anything I can remember playing in a platformer the inventive stages and set pieces in combination with these scissors made with some incredibly interesting and memorable puzzles of boss fights that's meant Puppeteer is one of the best Platformers on the PlayStation 3. as unique pistol gameplay is the creative visuals presented in Puppeteer are just as mind-blowing at times there's a clear amount of love that went into designing each and every aspect of the game from the characters to each individual stage I'll come across it's got a unique look that I can call its own if you fancy jumping into a platformer like no other then look no further than puppeteer the bulk of heavenly swords gameplay sees you taking up the Fighter's naracoat that she wields the heaven so there are three different stances with which naroko can wield the Heavenly sought there is a rage stance where the sword is whipped around with changed to strike groups of bows and clear the area there's also a speed stance which allows naraco to double wield the sword of matric Combos and lastly there is a power stance where we see the Heavenly sword as it appears in full but naraco's striping enemies with great thoughts switching in and out of each stance on the Fly whilst linking them with combos is essential to overcoming some of the more difficult enemies the game froze your way and luckily you can also counter attack which requires precise timing rewards you with an awesome mini cinematic and Enemy being completely owned by naraco now the learning curve is much deeper than God of War or Dynasty Warriors for example but you get an enormous feeling of satisfaction when you were able to pass the enormous amount of enemy soldiers it's one of the PlayStation 3's first exclusives I am blown away even now how gorgeous this game production plates the character detail in Heavenly sword is amazing and a lot of the game's recognition comes from naroko's awesome red hair that fluid the ABS and floats with every movement you make the environment suggest as impressive as well you'll see gargantuan fortresses Lush Mountain sights and literally hundreds of characters appearing on screen for narrow code to sweep through in some levels there is so much detail that the performance does step a bit but it's never enough to mess up the gameplay all of the locales are Grant and the dynamic camera does a great job of showing off the game's massive style if you've never got around to it back in the day or it is simply fond of hack and slashes there is plenty years about stuck into back in 2004 Sony released siren for the PlayStation 2 a very creepy survival horror game due to its poor sales numbers though we never saw the Super Bowl here in the west and instead we'd have to wait for a remake of the first game hit the PlayStation 3 for another chance to play the game the story sees an American TV crew traveling to Japan to search for hanuda a mysterious Village said to have disappeared after a landslide back into salmon teeth while searching for The Village the crew stumbles across the human sacrifice ritual and after one woman is murdered by its strange participants and otherworldly sirens sound soft and causes blood red rain to fall on the newly reappeared her noodle Village thou trap the American TV crew with a couple of her nudist's remaining residents must survive the Horus and find out the truth behind the sirens Court their blood pierces separated into 12 episodes each with 46 chapters each chapter has your completing a variety of objectives with a certain character that can range from get him to a certain point in the area protecting or obedient secondary character from dangers of finding certain items there are two ways to deal with deadly enemies populating The Village through stealthy infiltrations or through violence combating blockers is much better than the slower mundane system the original with your weapon in hand should now easily hold down one to radiate a new square or R1 to attack visually hanuda Villages excellently designed to look like the haunted desolate hellhole that has become everything from Wide Open Fields streets flooded with red water and a deserted hospital it became a very disturbing intense atmosphere that easily Rivals the likes of Silent Hill the Fatal Frame all in all siren blood piercings quite possibly one of the best horror games on the PlayStation 3. if you're up for a real stare then don't skip this one Battle Gear Solid 4 is without a doubt one of the most notorious games for being stuck on the PlayStation 3. it marks the end of solid's next journey in his fight against the Patriots which sees you traveling with low from the Middle East to South America and even some nostalgic locations for longtime fans throwing it and GS4 built off all of the systems that have come before it in the previous games we still managed to innovate into all its hat it was mainly achieved through the use of octo camosu this new ability streamlined every trip that was introduced in snow theater and allowed you to take on the texture of any object you're in contact with automatically this strip the somewhat cumbersome venue system and allows you to stay in the action which was significantly wrapped up as well instead of solely infiltrating an area and Jasper introduced a battlefield system that saw two factions Engage The Battle as the player you had the choice of a better in its outcome by supporting the local forces and choosing to do so would result in some pretty engaging situations that you wouldn't else find yourself in it's in these moments that the gameplay shine so with the generous amount of weapons to use you'll always find yourself customizing your current setup to suit your approach may that be the stealthy and not lethal path or deciding to act like rapper the gameplay facilitates both now there was no way I wasn't going to mention one of the most impressive aspects of the game and that are the visuals at the time they were nothing short of breath token and managed to still hold up incredibly well to the state and stance is a Real Testament to the power of the PlayStation 3 when it was in the right hand that would be Solid 4 is one hell of a journey and more importantly one knob is worth taking while that does it for today's video keep an eye out for part two as that will be coming up soon so don't forget to

the playstation 3 was home to the whole range of solid first person shooters but one that went above and beyond the mark had to be resistance free it carries on the narrative presented in the previous games and once again sees players taking on the invading force of the chimera as they try one last time to save humanity this time around though the game is simply bitter and better there's larger set pieces bigger battles larger skirmishes badder baddies and bosses and a tour around the midwest and east coast leading up to the ultimate goal of arriving in the now icy wasteland of new york city the art direction and its implementation is incredible and really helps pull off the look and feel of a scorched earth from the detailed textures to the well animated characters to the sound of your weapon firing such special effects could only be done with people who knew how to get the most out of the playstation 3 and insomniac definitely fit the build on the other hand the game sometimes struggles to keep up with itself at 30 frames per second and it occasionally the only when things get truly intense dips below but it's nothing that takes away from the overall experience remember me is severely underrated in my opinion sure it was never going to set the world on fire but its general premise and more importantly its presentation were some of the best to come out of the seventh generation brought to us by donknod who are now most famously known for life is strange remember me was quite a unique experience that brought together many different aspects to create something as of then unseen taking place in a futuristic paris players would assume the role of kneeling as they unravel a mystery that reached its highest the governing bodies of the city it all revolved around the concept of altering memories and was a fascinating and unusual approach to a dystopian future saturn and games the most striking aspect being the saturn itself the seamless blend of nature and technology lent the adventure of a distinct flavor from the towering skyline to the seedy underbelly of the city it managed to feel like a believable space and a genuine representation of how society could end up now all of the game takes place in either indoor or outdoor locations of neo paris it does a good job of mixing cramped and open looking environments though i say looking just because that's exactly what it is while you often see a bit into the distance the actual places you can go to were rather limited and end up feeling rather corridor-like i'd say this is where the game fails and i'm not gonna lie remember me does get quite boring after some time due to its rather mundane gameplay but when it comes to visuals there's no denying that it succeeds after the huge success of the first game it was a bit of a no-brainer that we would eventually get a sequel infamous 2 managed to improve and iterate on every aspect the original introduced which resulted in one of the best superhero games on the playstation 3.

visually the game is simply stunning the environments look great and a lot of attention is being paid to the small details that really make the game environment believable the city of new meres is much more colorful and lively than the empire city of the first infamous neon signs glow beautifully in the french quarter philadel looks absolutely ravaged after a major hurricane decimated the area and the gas works location combines ugly industrial buildings and some interestingly outplaced snowy regions it all looks fantastic and when you add calls flashy and sometimes downright impressive powers into the mix the screen really blows up of color now cole's animations are also nicely done he leaps and spins and slides his way across new maria's looking as authentic as an electric superhero can and the gracefulness that sucker punch was obviously trying for comes across really well if you've never played it but are fond of these types of games infamous 2 represents one of the best of the bunch and totally deserves a look after the first motorstorm success it was no surprise that many people would be looking forward to a sequel the unique blend of off-road racing and combat is something that resonated with many players and the second iteration pacific rift did not disappoint it boasted more tracks more cars and more importantly better visuals what the team achieved was breathtaking and pushed the playstation 3 to its absolute limits it moved away from the desert environments of old and instead focused upon a lush and vibrant location full of vegetation a lot of the scenery was fully destructible as well which brought a new life to the often static surroundings from volcanic mountain sides to the sandy beaches and run down factories there was a nice amount of diversity to each of the tracks that helped the overall game from becoming stale but during gameplay there is no game that quite does it like motorstorm the sense of speed and potency of each race is really like nowhere on the market one minute you'll find yourself sliding in the mud and leaving trails and the next frantically slamming into your opponent to slow their advance it all comes together to create one of the most exciting and rewarding races on the playstation 3 and thanks to the robust and challenging championship mode it is bound to last you some time as well after a somewhat lackluster outing with tools of destruction a crack in time was a breath of fresh air for the series not only did it spoil several new mechanics and ways to play but more importantly a new visual aesthetic that helped it stand out when compared to the previous entries there was just a lot more going on in general and insomnia i've clearly dabbled with this in the previous game with the mastering it fully for this one each level contains more detail both in the foreground and background which makes the game feel more alive and while the levels are all bright and visually appealing it's the character designs that really shine from the game's cast right down to individual enemies and bosses each of them all possess an incredible amount of detail and charm that helped to make them all feel like an integral part of the adventure a crack in time was a radical departure from what had come before the several tweaks to the formula as well as the new visual flourishes helped it become one of the best outings on the playstation 3 so if you're a fan of the series or just platformers in general it is well worth playing the playstation 3 was home to various unique exclusives one of them being a game known as puppeteer and quite like the name suggests it all revolves around puppets and more especially a show in which they take part in now is essentially a platformer and sees the player taken on the role of a young boy named kutaro and after being transformed into a wooden puppet he promptly loses his head thankfully due to his new found makeup you can simply replace it with another which forms the basis of the gameplay throughout each level it's an interesting and somewhat quirky setup but where puppeteer comes into its own is with its incredible visual presentation the cutesy 2d graphic look like something taken straight out of the orbit planet and japan's studio stays true to the whole theater theme that permeates the entire adventure the edges of red curtains will always be present at the top of the screen and you'll continuously go behind the layers of objects and environments as you progress through each location much like the changing of scenes in between acts when you go to see a real play at the theater as you make your way through the somewhat convoluted plot you'll find yourself encountering all sorts of eye-popping scenes from dark castle dungeons to bubbling green marshlands and forests it's a real sight to behold and although the gameplay won't light the world on fire the visual will get up more than makes up for it castlevania lords of shadow introduced an entirely new take on the series leaving behind its side-scrolling routes it instead presented an adventure that shared much in common with the likes of rhaegar or god of war now simply perhaps the visuals present and loads of shadow are some of the best i've seen on the playstation 3 a truly bold statement to make i know but there's loads of games out there with a little more technical detail than realism that surpasses what mercury's team accomplished but the sheer amount of creativity present in the enemy and level design more than makes up for any comparable faults you might find each chapter is quite unique in its presentation and some might argue that many of these environments fall well outside of what we would normally expect in a castlevania game but i for one found each of them a refreshing change of pace now once in combat the game really comes into its own the range of animations and the slew of special effects bring each encounter to life with each and every swing and punch although there's a few instances when the action gets too heavy the game does slow down a bit but it happened so infrequently that it would hardly detract from everything that the game gets right as a longtime fan of the series i was pleasantly surprised playing through loads of shadow it won't be for everyone and there's bound to be some purists out there that think this is the worst thing ever but if you're looking for a solid adventure with engaging and rewarding combat loads of shadow has got you covered the wipeout series has always been at the forefront when it comes to graphical fidelity right back to its first appearance on the ps1 to the eventual hd version that brought the entire series bursting into the modern era the first thing to mention is that it was one of the rare ps3 games that ran at 60 frames per second and in a 1080p resolution that alone is enough to celebrate the clear talent of the team behind it the best thing about it the frame rate manages to keep up with the sometimes insane speeds and pretty much never dips thanks to this the intensity of each run is at the forefront of the experience and really helps wipe out hd to become the best in the series much like the other entries a wide selection of machines and tracks make the cut the futuristic tone of the overall game oozes into every aspect of the experience from the gorgeous sun-drenched cities that the races took place in to each and every ship that possesses its own look and attributes topping all of this off for the range of special effects that accompany the generous amount of weapons and power-ups that the player can utilize from rockets to lasers and energy shields each of them look fantastic once executed if you're on the lookout for a new racer to get into and have run out of options on the playstation 3 wipe wipeout hd is an absolute must the metal gear solid series has always pushed the envelope when it comes to visual presentation even though many players probably experienced the phantom pain on the playstation 4. the ps3 version holds up surprisingly well and presents the same experience albeit not in the same fidelity or frame rate as it's at the time next-gen counterparts one aspect that will instantly stand out are the intricately detailed character models whether it be during gameplay or during cutscenes an incredible amount of attention is being put into each and helps to sell the believability of them this is no more apparent than during the signature kojima cinematics that litter the adventure they are all expertly directed and lend the game a movie like quality that its competitors can only dream of each location is vibrant and diverse from the scorching deserts of afghanistan to the dense jungles of africa and although the world can appear quite sparse at times it still manages to feel like a real space and looks phenomenal during play and thankfully the playstation 3 manages to hold its own and present the adventure in 30 frames per second although it does have a tendency to dip when the action heats up it's nothing less sour is the overall deal if you're a player who only has access to a playstation 3 the phantom pain is still a worthwhile adventure around the console when it comes to tactical rpgs valkyria chronicles has always been a series that stands out to me the first aspect that many will notice are the gorgeous watercoloured comic inspired visuals that help give the series an identity that i can call its own the result is stunning in its own right and refreshing and respect to the rest of the games on the market it strays away from the hyper-realism that dominates so much of gaming and fully succeeds each character model battlefield and unit are all lovingly created in style that helps the events of each encounter come to life in a truly mesmerizing way each animation plays out in a smooth fashion as well with each and every shot movement and strategy packing a real punch this is no more apparent than during the cutscenes that depict the narrative which take on an almost comic book aesthetic in their execution it really delivers the look and feel of a fantasy story and one that also parallels a world not so different than our own well that does it for today's video don't forget to hit subscribe and follow me on all of the socials to stay up to

### Transcript
Welcome to the show. Today we are talking about some hidden gems for the PlayStation 3. You have to know what to expect before going into Rain. If you expect a highly obvious, complex, or action-packed game, you're not going to find that here. However, if you enter it just wanting a fresh, artistic experience, you'll definitely be impressed. Rain is a beautiful, dark, and atmospheric game that introduces a unique mechanic which encourages the player to use the environment and weather in order to progress. The gameplay could be best described as stealth. You must traverse the area and find safety under shelter in order to evade the many monsters that litter the environment. The story is simplistic and doesn't come with any real twists, but the water visual style and most importantly the music all elevate the short but memorable experience. As with many games, Rain isn't without its flaws and certainly some of the better ideas needed to be developed further. The text narrative that is at first helpful in explaining the plot soon becomes rather intrusive and often leads the player by the hand rather than allowing them to explore things for themselves. While it was only ever a minor annoyance, I could also have done without a number of deaths that were caused by some rather unhelpful camera angles. But despite its flaws, Rain is an easy game to enjoy.

The immersive atmosphere more than makes up for the few negative points that are present. And if you're a fan of Limbo, Journey, or even Unfinished Swan, then this is exactly the kind of game I would recommend.
The Alchemist of Our Land is a throwback to the earlier days of the franchise when the management of time, alchemic resources, and money was the center of the experience and not simply a feature in an otherwise traditional turn-based JRPG. In this game, you have no great epic quest nor evil opponents. It is the story of a young alchemist apprentice striving to save her workshop during a three-year period, performing quests given to her by the kingdom to prove her usefulness. The slice of life atmosphere of the plot coupled with the sheer number of things to do. A ton of quests, not to mention plot branches and many different endings manages to give the game a unique identity. And even if some features could have been better, the battle system admittedly is a little bit on the simplistic side, the game is highly enjoyable, provided you don't expect a traditional JRPG experience. First off, Proteius could be described as something other than a game. It has no enemies, no save points, no skills, no weapons, no levels, and even no way to die. What it does have is a fantastic environment that even though pixelated is quite beautiful, a dynamic soundtrack which changes depending on what you're interacting with at the time, and a sense of wonderment, mystery, and exploration that is truly unique to the game. I often play this as it is so easy to get lost and swept up in the environment that the worries of day-to-day life seem to disappear. And for that reason alone, I believe Proteius is truly special. Ultimately, your experience of the game will depend on what you want out of it. I had a real need for something like this when I came across it and fell in love with the charming atmosphere of the game that invokes an emotional response. You may be content with staying on the menu screen just to listen to the relaxing music or explore an island of your own which contains forests, snowcap mountains, and beauty in every corner.

As you explore, you might come upon some playful animals to chase through the woods or a path leading to something new and unexpected quite like the game itself.
While it's not perfect, Valkyrie Chronicles is certainly nothing less than a fantastic game. While the story is somewhat over the top, it is highly engrossing and becomes hard not to feel for the plight of these soldiers torn from their peaceful life and thrown into war. The main cast of characters are a memorable group with unique personalities and a decent amount of development, while the supporting cast is large and varied, and each one has a reasonable amount of backstory to them, too. Moreover, the group as a whole becomes really memorable as you pick and choose characters that you like and that work well together thanks to the great potential system. The visuals are absolutely gorgeous, especially if you're fond of anime, and the musical score serves the on-creen action well.

But where this game truly shines is within its combat. And at first, it can look complicated, but it's easy to learn and leads to great battle sequences.
There are some minor camera issues when you're in tight quarters, and an element of chance comes into play during combat that can be frustrating at times, but these minor faults are nothing considering the quality of every aspect of this game. Heavenly Sword is one of the best adventure games the PlayStation 3 has to offer. Graphically, this game still stands up to this day and is impressive considering it was a launch title for the system. You take control of Naro, who has many options in combat with moves that require a bit of technical ability to execute mixed in with standard combos. While it's entirely possible to beat the game just by bashing buttons, it is certainly more satisfying to take the time to learn at least a few of the combos and use them strategically, as it will make the game much easier. For those with good timing, there is also a counterattack option, which becomes an automatic kill when executed in a short enough time.

Defeating enemies fills up your superstar gauge, which allows for some devastating attacks that can literally level armies. The story in Heavenly Sword is incredible and is guaranteed to pull a few cords by the time the credits have rolled, mainly due to the voice acting that really helps bring life to the characters and the events they are experiencing. If you're a fan of the God of War series, this one is a no-brainer and deserves a spot on your shelf. Vanquish is simply amazing. It takes all the standards of coverbased shooters and turns them on their head to create a new experience in a genre that by this point is over familiar. Sure, there is cover in this game, but you will only spend mere seconds at a time in it to restore your power suits energy. The rest of the time will be spent using said energy to perform maneuvers that elevate Vanquish's standard gameplay to something that looks like a meticulously choreographed cutscene of your own design. The two techniques that use energy are rocket sliding and slowing time, and the rapid juxtaposition of the two is highly encouraged. Both of these techniques are actually far more effective in preventing damage than coverage, and both are highly aggressive maneuvers.

Levels won't cease to amaze you until the game is over with new set pieces that crop up everywhere. Admittedly, Vanquish is quite short, but the replay value will come from the gameplay. Not much can be said about the story, at times appearing to parody itself. It reminds me of the good old be movie quality that was so prominent in the '90s.
El Shadai is above all else a prime example of how a video game can transcend its genre conventions to become something more. This game is both gorgeous and unique with constantly shifting visuals that somehow straddle the line between religious imagery and Tron-like aesthetics. You take control of a heaven scribe as you hunt the fallen Gregori angels and deliver them to God before he decides to wipe out the planet with a great flood. pretty minimal in its presentation. The game uses no health bars or other UI elements on screen and represents all relevant stats through visual changes. As a result, there is no inventory management either. Power upgrades and weapon changes are all instantaneous. The combat feels a lot like Devil May Cry or Bayonetta. Some players may find the combat to be a bit repetitive, but with its inherent depth and the addition of platforming, environmental puzzle solving, and even driving, things stay fresh through the 10 to 12 hours of gameplay. Overall, I had a blast with El Shadai, and its combination of visual flare and great storytelling truly makes it a hidden gem for the system. Resonance of Fate is a game that still leaves an impression with me today. I picked this one up on a whim a few years ago during the gaming dry season and was hooked until the end. The main story can be confusing at times since the main narrative is pushed to the background to explore the interaction between the three protagonists. It's all done in a very anime way. So, if you find this form of storytelling annoying, I would not recommend it for its story alone.

Gameplay-wise, the beauty of this game comes with its ability to stay consistently difficult throughout most of the playthrough and reward the player for using the game's mechanics to their advantage. Admittedly, the game does not explain these concepts explicitly enough and as a result might turn off a few people, but personally, I quite like it as it gave me a reason to experiment with the tools at hand. If you can get past the combat wall, you will be rewarded with an experience like no other.

The PS3 version is an enhanced port of the original 360 game with additional characters and different endings. What I like most about this game is that unlike many other RPGs, it does not force you to grind or farm stuff for hours and hours. Instead, all the important items you will need can be found through exploring the areas, which is actually a pleasure due to the environments being nothing other than beautiful. Fighting in this game is a lot of fun and easy to learn, but with some tricks once you delve deeper into the systems behind the action. Eternal Sonata contains some of the most beautiful music I have ever experienced in a game and goes a long way in complenting the story's high points. Some of the dungeons are quite complex and the inclusion of a map that you can complete by exploring would have been useful or at least a percentage telling you how much of the map you have explored already. However, this does not change the fact that this is one of the best JRPGs for the PS3. If you're a fan of the late great Shammu, then you should immediately check out the Yakuza franchise. While Su Cruiser 3 doesn't quite achieve the level of dignity depicted in the Shamu games, it does have a lot of similar elements, namely the real world locations and the free roaming RPG mechanics. That said, the game isn't a Shamu wannabe as its tone is completely different. Yakuza 3 has a great sense of humor that sees you beating the holy crap out of anyone who even looks at you funny. Stamping on a man's face, using a traffic cone as a golf club, and a dude's head as a ball. This [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] seriously never stops being funny, especially when said victims get up from their beatings and profusely apologize to you. The actual combat is tight and fun. The plot is totally nuts, but at the same time very convoluted and could potentially turn a few people away, but trust me, if you stick with it, you will find a very engaging story that needs to be played to keep you busy. There are a ton of mini games that add a lot to the value of the game. And to be honest, you could potentially spend more time indulging in side quests and mini games more than the main narrative, but that's not a problem. Yakuza 3 made me a full-on franchise fan and I would like to give a shout out to a fan of the show, Blackman, who introduced me to the series.

syndicate is a reimagining of a pc classic that bears the same name released in 1993 the original was an isometric strategy game and nearly 20 years later starbury studios would bring the title back and instead present it as a first person shooter he sees you playing the part of an elite agent who's enlisted in an experimental trial involving something known as the dart six trip this chip gives him the ability to subvert the systems in other people's heads and hack the environment around him a ton of gameplay opportunities sprint up from this simple concept with the most useful mechanic being something known as dark vision which easily highlights all of the enemies on screen but there is so much more to this system as you also have access to several skills or apps as they're known in the game one being the breach app which allows the player to control and manipulate the environment to their will such as remotely unlocking doors reprogramming turrets or disabling your enemy's armor mixing all of these aspects together soon becomes key to progressing through each and every obstacle the game will throw at you thanks to the pretty robust upgrade system as well you'll always be coming across new abilities that help the gameplay remain fresh taking out high profile targets allows you to gruesomely extract their chips and use them to upgrade your health accuracy the length you can use your dart vision and a whole range of other unique expertise like i mentioned before it's not the best shooter on the system but if you're looking for something accessible and most importantly enjoyable syndicate is a great option shadows of the damned comes off as a niche game that will only appeal to a certain crowd and to a certain extent that is correct however survival horror and action fans who enjoy some juvenile comedies sprinkled in will find a surprisingly solid title from start to finish now when it comes to gameplay shadows of the damned plays a lot like resident evil 4 and takes place from an over-the-shoulder perspective the atmosphere of the game is visibly darker than the humor that's present jokes about male genitalia are very common but are presented in such a way that they come off as actually being funny you'll constantly be battling and dismembering demons with your psychic and also a motorcycle and interchangeable weapon you'll have a pistol a shotgun and a machine gun with their own demonic and comedic overtones each acting level is broken down by the same style of gameplay you enter an area find a brain or an eyeball which acts as keys to open a door that progresses the story you'll usually find yourself encountering a boss during these moments which soon become the real star of the show every time you defeat one you gain a major upgrade gem that changes and improves one of your weapons and prepares you for what's coming next it's not all shooting and dick jokes though a healthy amount of puzzles is scattered throughout the adventure and really help break up the gameplay and keep it from becoming mundane some of them are true head scratchers as well and will test even the most proficient of players if you're looking for a fun and easy to jump into game on the playstation 3 shadows of the damned is bound to put a smile on your face bizarre creations have always been well known for the various racing games they've developed from the likes of project gotham to the dreamcast classic msr they have always been masters of their craft blue takes the most popular licensed vehicles and allows you to race them against other competitors however with the added bonus of collecting power-ups very much in the vein of mario kart and using them against your opponents to win the race now the career mode is where most of the action takes place you progress through it by taking part in several events and completing milestones to unlock the next tier each tournament has a number of events you must complete before earning the right to race the leader and win their car most of them are standard circuit races but there are some driver jewels time trials and destruction events that task you with destroying other cars thanks to this variety making your way through the career mode soon becomes an absolute blast there are also minor goals in each event gaining fans is one of the most important as they are essentially the point system for this game players can accumulate fans by shooting up the competition driving stylishly or getting a podium finish furthermore each tournament has a number of goals to complete before challenging the bots such as destroying a certain number of cars or performing a specific feat like knocking another car off the track into water as you would expect to eventually come to possess a wide range of vehicles ranging from the ford focus right up to the nissan skyline there's a generous amount available naturally they all differ in their ability in both handling and speed which makes unlocking and trying all of them out essential to getting the most out of the game player has to be one of the most enjoyable and unique races on the playstation 3.

if you're looking for something fun to get into blair has got you covered binary domain is a science fiction team-based third-person shooter a bit like the years of war except set in the future of japan where an organization who produces robots are committing serious crimes as the player you take up the fight is sergeant dan marshall and is sent in to bring those responsible to justice not third-pacing shooters every time it doesn't but what helps binary domains stand out is a unique mechanic known as the trust system now unlike various trust systems that have existed in the past such as the trust commands in the odd world series pokemon not respecting you until you attain a certain badge or the numerous rpgs where party characters who have issues with protagonists will do whatever they want binary domain's trust system is varied and diverse it sees you commanding your teammates and depending on how you treat them can affect the outcome of the entire game each command is handled with a simple button press but can also be done by issuing voice commands but i do not recommend playing this way as the game has a tendency to not always understand what you're trying to say of course without solid gunplay to back up this system binary domain would fall flat on its feet but it's safe to say the minute to minute gameplay is engaging and rewarding darting in and out of cover as you take on the onslaught of threats is such a satisfying feeling and of course you have many options when it comes to doing so there's a healthy amount of weapons in the game which can all be upgraded for a shop that you gain access to at the end of each mission each action you carry out will net you points which can be spent here on a whole variety of different items that will help your cause now visually binary domain is a real looker each environment feels like a believable take on a futuristic world the cast of characters are all animated well and help bring the events that transpire to life in a meaningful way if this one passed you by when it was first released it well and truly deserves a go lost planet was one of the first games that got me excited for next gen but it ended up being one of those games that you're either going to love or hate the premise sees humanity traveling to a distant planet known as eden 3. it's pretty hostile environment full of snow ice mountains canyons and a nasty insect like raced up the acrid now the humans want to colonize this planet because earth has become too polluted to support mankind the first attempt of colonization failed but some humans stayed on the planet instead of leaving thus becoming snow pirates this is where the player comes in and takes up the part of wayne holden who's hell bent on avenging his father's death at the hands of the aliens the control mechanics take a bit of getting used to it first but once you get the hang of it it all comes together as a set of very tight and responsive commands that feel quite natural of course you come to possess a wide variety of weapons as well as vehicles known as suits which are essentially bipedal mechs but at the core of the gameplay something known as thermal energy is essentially your life support your vital suits fuel as well as your energy weapons ammo so if you run out of it you're gonna be in big trouble balancing your play style with your stock of thermal is the name of the game which adds a nice amount of strategy to the experience instead of just running and shooting anything that moves like i mentioned earlier it's not going to be for everyone but for those that it clicks with lost planet is unforgettable the ps3 was always well known for its incredible exclusives but one that is largely being forgotten has to be a game called ring it's an entirely unique experience that revolves around a young boy as he awakes in a mysterious world he soon notices a faint silhouette of a girl and concerned for her safety sets out to catch up with her now a curious aspect of the story is that it's told without any voiced characters or dialogue from a narrator there is narration but it's done through white aerial attacks that appears around the environment when the player moves into specific locations this aspect will really help draw you into the adventure the gameplay on offer is extremely simplistic the boy himself doesn't possess any special powers just the ability to walk and climb but like the name suggests rain plays a huge role in the overall gameplay with the boy only being while standing in it you're not alone though as several creatures also stalk the streets and will hunt you down across the city the catch being that they can only see you in the rain and this is where stealth comes into play and it begins to feel like a game of cat and mouse of course that's not the only obstacle you'll come across as several puzzles also litter the environment but they're all pretty straightforward and won't cause too much of a headache unfortunately one aspect that lets the game down though is its run time it's only going to last you about three hours which is a bit disappointing if i'm being honest but it doesn't take away from everything that the game gets right rain is one of the reasons why i love video games it's a medium of entertainment that offers so much variety and it doesn't matter if a game is well known or as physically rewarding as another title because it has other aspects that make it an absolute pleasure to play this is so true for ring the playstation 3 was home to many quality platformers but one that never got the recognition deserved has to be alice madness returns her journey is essentially the tale of her struggling to live with her shattered life and recover her memories which the game does a great job of showcasing and sprinkles well-produced cutscenes throughout to depict its narrative the story soon becomes one of the best parts of the adventure and when it comes to gameplay you will find and use an assortment of weaponry alice of course has her signature knife but is also armed with a pepper grinder which acts like a machine gun a hobby horse which plays the role of the most powerful weapon and lastly a teapot which allows the player to take on enemies from even greater distances switching between these weapons is extremely easy and due to them all having their own distinct advantages utilizing each of them in battle is absolutely essential especially during some of the more intense boss encounters which soon become a real highlight of the adventure now the platforming in the game is fairly standard alice has a very generous triple jump accompanied by the ability to float giving you quite a range when it comes to jumping it really comes in handy when exploring and trying to locate the huge amount of collectibles that litter the environment it's not all sunshine and rainbows though i'm not gonna lie alice madness returns could have done with some more time in the oven the visuals suffer with an unhealthy amount of tearing and at times it can become troublesome but not to the point where it becomes unbearable but it's worth mentioning nonetheless if you're looking for a great platformer to get stuck into on the playstation 3 alice madness returns is well worth checking out despite the several aspects that keep it from achieving greatness asura's wrath draws its inspiration from hindu mythology about god's combat and demons in order to keep balance between what essentially equates to the world and heaven you take on the role of asura who is one of the guardian generals fighting the demons alongside his siblings who at some point turn on him thus comes his wrath and it only escalates from there you'll fight your way through waves of different enemies ranging from demonic elephants statues total minigames and the gods themselves as you exact your revenge upon anyone and everyone nabasaura's wrath draws from a multitude of genres ranging from rail shooters to third person action and quite a few quick time events sprinkled throughout and whether you're jumping around punching everything in sight flying through space on a motorcycle shooting whatever comes your way or responding to qtes everything is extremely well done asura has a very simple combat system at his disposal utilizing a light attack for combos heavy attacks that take time to recharge projectiles and jumping along with counter attacks as well as a parry and varying dodge maneuvers that help with defense as i said the combat system is simple and to some this may be a bad thing but i see it as a good one when you have short bouts with multiple enemies the last thing we want to do is micromanage your skills every time furthermore not every game needs to have an overly complicated combat system all in its own especially when it can have many other things that define it the whole presentation is very well done and whether you're a fan of action games or anime you're sure to get some enjoyment out of it and if you happen to be a fan of both well serious wrath will certainly be right up to your street folklore offers up one of the best rpgs the playstation 3 has to offer and unfortunately it landed well under the radar upon its initial release now the narrative is quite different from other rpgs it's not generic or just about saving the world rather it's a mystery story involving a girl's puzzling and repressed past you get to play as two different characters keats and ellen pete is a reporter who writes for an occult magazine and ellen is just a lonely girl trying to find her mother after a series of events unfold the two soon set out to visit a place known as the neverworld that consists of several realms in the hopes of locating allen's mother in the netherworld your character must battle against the creatures that inhabit it known as folks your goal is to collect these creatures and use their abilities in battle to defeat and collect other types of them at the end of each realm you'll face off against a boss or folklore and defeating it will usually send you back to doolin village a sort of hub area where you can finish up the story for that particular chapter once in battle utilizing the folk comes into play you can choose up to four of them at any one time with them all being assigned to the face buttons for quick access there's at least 100 different folks that all come with their own distinct abilities to use in the game the combinations you can come up with are almost endless and help keep combat from becoming stale naturally with it being an rpg each of your folk could be leveled up and fully customized to your specific style of play this really comes in handy when building the perfect team that are fit for anything the game throws at you visually whilst not the best looking game on the playstation 3 folklore is certainly one of the most artistic matching this is the individual enemy and character designs that fit well with the subject matter and atmosphere that the claim creates if this one passed you by back in the day it well and truly deserves a playthrough especially for fans of rpgs when the playstation 3 first launched there weren't that really many games that cemented it is sony's next giant experience but one that stood out had to be heavenly sword to this day it still manages to look fantastic and thanks to its engaging gameplay is aged incredibly well the player takes on the part of naruko a lady who is tasked with protecting a divine sword from the forces who seek to use its power for evil naruko and her destined weapon are firing away the best part of heavenly sword for sure the combat is fun and challenging but the narrative following naruko's destiny is so well told that watching the story play out might actually be more exciting naruko holds an intense hatred towards the heavenly sword that eventually shifts into something more meaningful and their determination to wipe out our enemies plays out in a mesmerizing fashion there are three different stances with which narco can wield the sword there's a ranged stance where the sword is whipped around with chains to strike groups of foes and clear the area there's also a speed stance which allows narroco to double wield the sword and make her at combos and lastly there is a power stance where we see the heavenly sword is it appears in full with nariko striking enemies with incredible force each of these stances must be used at the correct times simply pressing buttons will not get you very far combining all three of them together results in stylish and beautiful sword fighting from naruko and the more stylish you attack in combo the more hidden attacks you can unlock for the heavenly sword heavenly swords gameplay is innovative and challenging and it offers a very different approach from what you might be used to in other action games that helps it stand out from the likes of devil may cry and god of war well that does it for today's video don't forget to hit subscribe and tickle that bell you can follow me on all of the

Warhammer 40,000 Space Marines is a third person shooter that throws you into the role of Captain Titus as his army struggle to defend their world from an invasion of ORS who will stop at nothing to claim it for themselves when it comes to game play it shares a lot of similarities with years of war but branches out and instead of solely relying on shooting you've got a pretty extensive amount of melee attacks that quickly flip the game into a beat them up and it's this constant juggling between shooting and fighting that makes Space Marines so much fun when it comes to the combat you have an attack and stun button which can be used to devise several different combos with enemies who have been properly stunned will have a circular icon above their heads and will be ripe for an execution as you would expect these are often brutal and Savage actions and when you throw your melee weapons into the mix as well it makes for some truly gut-wrenching gameplay when you're not up close and personal and hacking away at your enemies the shooting is pretty solid and provides you with many different weapons to make use of such as the melter gun which is this game's answer for a shotgun or the L Cannon which is a high-powered sniper rifle with limited ammo and many many more that are all built for certain situations will help spice up the game play even more the different enemies you'll come across is each of them pose a different threat from The Fast and nimbol to slower and more powerful they can appear at any time throughout each Mission which demands that the player thinks on their toes and makes use of each and every option within their Arsenal to sum it up Space Marines boasts a very fun and engaging campaign and if you're a fan of Warhammer this one is an absolute must binary domain is quite possibly one of the most overlooked and underappreciated games from the Seventh Generation developed by the same Minds behind the Yakuza series it's a third squad-based shooter that brings some incredible ideas of its own to the table it all takes place well into the future and follows Dan Marshall and his team of elite soldiers as they work to counteract the threat of untraceable Androids who have seemingly embedded themselves into society I'm W going into too much detail as the story is surprisingly one of the better aspects of the game that's perfect to play through without knowing much before jumping in now on the gameplay front binary domain is your standard cover based shooter but what helps mix it up is the huge focus on team tactics that lies at the heart of the action known as the trust system it sees you issuing voice commands through the use of your headset but unfortunately it's not exactly accurate and more often than not they won't respond or carry out your commands but thankfully this can be remedied by simply using the controller instead which I found a lot easier and quicker even when firing and running at the same time further helping binary domain exceed the various light RPG mechanics sprinkled throughout the campaign this mainly comes in the form of buying and upgrading uping a selection of weapons and armor for yourself and your team and allows you to focus on creating a formidable Force that's ready for whatever the game throws at you next for a team that's solely focused on producing Yakuza games binary domain was a welcome change of pace and his hoping that one day they decide to return to the futuristic shooter and build upon the fantastic foundation they created the only chambara Series has always been known for its over-the-top action women in swimsuits on Gore and kagura on the PlayStation 3 is no exception it's basically a hack and slasher that sees you taking on the fight as one of several characters and you'd be forgiven for thinking that due to the adult theme of the game that there wasn't much else to it but there's a surprisingly deep amount going on underneath the hood when it comes to the several mechanics that make it up the game play is simple and you're free to perform one of several Combos and take advantage of a range of different weapons that all have their own pros and cons from Spears to boomerang and swords they all have a place on the battlefield but what makes it quite unique is the blood system the more blood and gore that your weapon racks up the less damage it does so you often have to pause to clean it off now the concept of quite literally having to reload your sword might seem a bit stupid but it adds an element of danger to the combat that doesn't often exist in most hack and slashes you can't just rely on the most powerful weapon and muscle through each fight because at one point or another you won't be able to do any damage without finding a safe spot to clean it off when it comes to visuals it seems that most of the budget went into the kills themselves with each of them coming along with a decent amount of detail as well as Unique Designs that give all of them their own style the battlefield is often littered with several enemies at once and the frame rate does a respectable job of holding strong as the action heats up unfortunately it's all over pretty quickly with the game only clocking in at about 6 hours but with so many costumes extra characters and weapons to unlock there's still plenty of reasons to jump back in once the C a r I'm a huge fan of Fist and the North Star may that be the anime or mangas that have released over the years and when it comes to games the franchise has also had its fair share of attempts to translate the brutal nature of the series with Ken's rage offering up one of the best it plays quite similar to Dynasty Warriors and sees you tackling a range of different missions as you fight back against an endless wave of enemies that try to stop you dead in your tracks of course there's a huge emphasis upon maral arts and Ken has got many ways to get the job done mainly through the use of three different styles that offer up several moves and abilities depending on the situation at hand may that be when you're surrounded or picking off enemies from a distance and for when the action really ramps up you can take advantage of one of Ken's special moves that are all beholden to a meter whilst fighting and Landing successful hits this gauge will slowly rise and when it's full you get to unleash one of four different abilities that have varying effects such as being able to punch some pour sod 100 times in the space of a few seconds to large area based attacks that will chip away at large crowds allowing you to turn the tide of the battle even when the odds are clearly stacked against you when it comes to progression the game does a great job it's defeating enemies also when you Karma and collecting a enough levels you up giving you skill points to spend and alter Ken's Effectiveness over time this aspect really drew me in as for fans of the series you'll come across a lot of moves made Popular by The Source material and getting to perform them and see them play out will put a stupid grin on your face overall the game is not without its issues but when it comes to Pure unadulterated fun Ken's rage is definitely worth picking up Splatterhouse is a game that has roots leading all the way back to the days of the arcades with the original releasing in 1988 and several sequels that would hit the home consoles of the time after a long Hiatus the series received a reboot that once again saw you taken on the fight as Rick as you done the wise cracking terror mask and Chase down the infamous Dr West all in the hopes of saving your girlfriend who's been kidnapped the story was never the series strong point and here there's no change in that department but what helps set it apart is the bloody and violent gameplay that lies at the core of the experience it takes the form of a beatam up as you make your way from one room to the next Gathering Collectibles along the way and clearing each stage of enemies in a variety of gruesome ways you get a lot to play with as you advance ranging from meat Cleavers and pipes to the severed body parts of your enemies which can all be used to your advantage of course you've got a series of basic combos as well and with certain attacks working better for specific enemies approaching each fight soon becomes a strategic Affair and not just about blindly bashing everything in sight during the course of the game you get blood the game's currency and with it you can purchase new skills to use or boost your health but also save it to perform one of the many splatter attacks that are basically a special moves there's quite a few of them and they are just as violent as brutal as you would expect with many relying on QuickTime events in order to pull them off they add a lot of spectacle to the game and they're likely to turn a few stomachs as they play out when it comes down to it if you're looking for a game that's not afraid to take full advantage of its mature rating then Splatterhouse will be just a ticket ever since the first games on the PlayStation the Twisted M Series has prided itself on violence and destruction and the 2012 reboot would tape this premise to new heights and ultimately provide one of the best entries in the franchise you're once again thrown into a tournament that sees its contestants fighting it out on the road in one of many different vehicles with each of them armed to the teeth with a huge range of weapons such as miniguns and Rockets that bring life to the absolute Mayhem of each event these range from the classic Last Man Standing death match to more interesting Concepts like the electric cage match that sees you trying to take everyone else within a w off space there are also several racing stages in the game and they are by far the most difficult not only do you almost have to drive perfectly but you also have to avoid all of the attacks from your Rivals which makes for some truly hectic gameplay there is a wide variety of vehicles each with their own armor speed and special weapons as well as other traits like how quickly they recharge their energy bar while the vehicles and weapons are important the battlefields where all this Mayhem takes place are just as significant there's eight maps in total which range from ruined cities open Canyons to the rooftops of La each of them manag to feel unique and with several obstacles such as ws and the destructible elements of each space there's plenty of ways you can use them to your advantage due to its arcade style nature Twisted Metal will provide nonon endless amounts of replayability with countless hours of fast-paced action and destruction that's just as enjoyable to play today as it was back when it first released The Godfather the Don Edition is essentially a retooled version of the PlayStation 2 game and comes along with a few changes in improvements that ultimately make it the best way to experience this forgotten classic based almost entirely within the time span of the first movie The Godfather put you into the shoes of an upand cominging player in the colon family business who is seeking revenge on the brazini family for killing his father you get to create him from scratch and then once you're done you're free to explore the 1940s Recreation of New York City you take on jobs and work towards rising in the ranks of the family now as this is a Sandbox game the expected run and Gun comp opponents are on the surface present but it's not just a mere GTA clone as it's also got a few ideas of its own and this is mainly during combat hand to hand fighting is dealt with not by a single button but by the right analog stick much like the a fight Knight and sure you could just pump wildly on the right stick but you'd leave yourself wide open for counterattacks and a swift defeat so taking your time and devising combos is the best way to come out on top the same is true for the gunfights as running into situations gung-ho will likely result in failure so taking advantage of the cover system is the best way to help you stand your ground as well as utilizing one of the many weapons ripped straight from the film at the right time to be fair even these descriptions shed only a small amount of light on the combat system there is a lot left unmentioned as part of the fun of the controls is to learn new moves executions and strategies that I'll leave up to you to discover if you're a fan of the films or just open world sandboxes in general then the Godfather is definitely worth playing when it first released back in 2014 killer is dead didn't Fair too well when it came to reviews and largely was received quite negatively as a fan of suda 51's work I didn't let that hold me back from picking it up and I'm glad I didn't as although it's clearly a bit rough around the edges Killer's dead offers an experience like no other and it's all broken up into a series of episodes that follow Mondo Zappa an assassin who works for a mysterious organization is you hack and slash your way to the end the game play is where it truly shines and feels like an evolution of the No More Heroes formula and instead of just mindlessly mashing a button to win the game throws in a whole bunch of tactics like range weaponry and emphasizes the use of your Dodge and defeating enemies what makes the combat different from noral Heroes though is Mondo's cybernetic which can morph into four different weapons that are unlocked through complete inside missions the four weapons require blood in order to be used that can be picked up from defeated enemies but that same blood Mondo CX can also be used to heal himself which creates a nice amount of risk versus reward besides from collecting blood from Fallen enemies Mondo can also earn yellow crystals that allow the player to unlock new moves and upgrade their weapons which adds a little Freedom when it comes to building him in a way that suits your style of play if I'm being honest though one disappointing aspect of the game has to be the boss fights which never really put up too much of a challenge and it's just a case of studying their movements and attack patterns and waiting for the right moment to strike it would have been nice to have seen a bit more to them but thankfully the minute to- minute combat with normal enemies more than makes up for it overall the confusing story and short length of the game do let it down a bit but the game play is where it's at its best so if you can find it for a cheap price playing it is absolutely worthwhile siren blood curse is basically a reimagining of the first game on the PlayStation 2 with many alterations to the game structure and improvements to its gameplay it all takes place in a secluded Japanese village where a mysterious ceremony in the woods is accidentally cut short by suda a young man who takes on the role of the main character and soon finds himself wrapped up in a terrifying town you eventually come to play as several other characters who are also trapped in the area and been cut off from the rest of the World by a supernatural River of blood where all of The Village's inhabitants have turned into The Walking Dead they will attack Chase and even shoot you upon sight so you must learn to efficiently and quietly sneak past them whilst trying to fulfill one of the many objectives each Mission brings to be fair there's not that much Variety in what they ask you to do we've most basically seeing you making it from point A to point B Alive or doing so while guiding along a companion what makes siren quite unique however is the inclusion of a mechanic known as sight tracking it allows you to understand what a human or monster in the area sees and hears letting you determine its location as well as gain knowledge of their activities and the position of obtainable items that can help you out with the game promoting that you avoid enemies rather than and stay in fight this feature soon becomes your most valuable asset as you carefully plan Your Way Forward not knowing what is out there and what could be out there is a feeling that siren absolutely nails and because of it the level of unasal experience whilst playing it is off the charts there really isn't anything else like siren and in spite of its unusual control scheme the immersive world of scares it creates is something you won't easily forget if you could sum up wet in one word it would have to be ambition as it's clear to see that a lot of f went into the game but several missteps do keep it from reaching the heights it aimed for but not in a way that totally ruins the experience as a whole it's a third person shooter with several platforming elements thrown in as you take on the role of Ruby a foulmouthed mercenary whose No Nonsense approach adds a ton of humor to the story and as long as she gets paid she doesn't care what the job entails if you've ever played the likes of Max pain you'll instantly feel familiar with the several mechanics that make up wet mainly the huge focus on slowing down time and using it to accurately pick off enemies but where it differs is the use of Ruby's acrobatic abilities that also come into play just as much as the shooting itself jumping wall running or sliding along the ground on your knees she is well equipped to outsmart the enemy and getting to grips with these Powers is at the center of what makes wet so enjoyable to play regardless of some of its more shoddy aspects this is mainly the difficulty which is offset by Ruby's abilities is there is no limit on entering bullet time and you're also given an unlimited amount of hang and ammo where at points it just feels like you're cheating your way through the game thankfully it does feel incredibly satisfying to do so but it would have been nice to have seen some limitations such as a gauge that forces you to use your skills strategically that would have added some more challenge to the game playay all in all though W is still a solid game that doesn't overstay its welcome with its great sense of style replay ability and explosive action it's a real blast to make your way through and with it still being available for quite cheap it's definitely something worth considering well that does it for

i didn't know anything about invasion until the viewer brought it to my attention a few months back so i decided to give it a go and while on the surface it might just look like another generic over-the-shoulder shooter there's some pretty interesting ideas that it brings to the table and while it doesn't quite execute it perfectly envisioned surprised me and felt fresh amongst the sea of similar experiences on the console firstly what helps it stand out is one of the main mechanics you'll be using throughout the game early on you'll be able to equip a device that lets you make the gravity in a particular area either heavier or lighter you can then use this in combat is an enemy hiding behind cover you can hit them with some low gravity to make them float up is an enemy charging at you hit them with some high gravity to pin them to the floor but aside from the obvious combat implications you'll also need to use gravity to progress through the levels you'll play through by creating your own paths this will cause you to for example travel and fight on the ceiling instead of the floor or perhaps you'll jump between the floor and the wall to fight enemies it adds an extra layer of strategy to the gameplay on the other hand visually envision really excels and thanks to the gravity mechanic it results in some rather impressive vistas but the game does suffer from some technical issues the most notable being pop in and tearing which is a bit disappointing but again it's nothing that completely ruins the game if you're looking for a solid shooter to get into envision would make a welcome addition to anyone's collection at the time of its release it had been a while since players had their hands on a new entry in the twisted metal series after a couple of intimate releases including a game on the psp and the relaunch of twisted battle black the series made a comeback in an attempt to rekindle the joys of vehicle combat and destruction as with all of the games the story revolves around the tournament where vehicles outfitted with weapons of destruction fight to the death this tournament named twisted metal is run by the enigmatic and sinister calypso who promises one wish to the victor of his competition whereas previous twisted metal games feature a host of unique characters and vehicles who all have their individual histories motivations and desires this twisted metal features only three central figures the psychotic serial killer sweet tooth the biker and daredevil mr grim and finally the envious supermodel dollface the story is a bit of an afterthought and never really delivers anything compelling but the frantic and chaotic gameplay this series is known for is its saving grace there is a wide variety of vehicles each with their own armor speed and statistics as well as other nuances like how quickly you can recharge the energy bar and special weapons while vehicles and weapons are important the battlefields where all this mayhem takes place are of equal significance there's eight of them in total and furthermore the added destructibility of various walls and buildings adds the possibility to discover new areas overall whilst it's not the best in the series by any means twisted battle is still a great time will likely satisfy fans and newcomers alike with its over-the-top combat and destruction imagine in the forsaken kingdom is a mixture of ideas lifted from various games before it and like many meals prepared with diverse ingredients while it tastes good it can be a bit rough around the edges now it's a puzzler at heart and draws much inspiration from the likes of eco but unlike that game combat manages to play a huge role here and is key to advancing through a level of which there are around 40 spread through five diverse areas you control tipu and give orders to the big guy imagine you can command him in several ways attack follow wait feed in five ways relating to magic that can also be learned it really does require you to work as a team as your attacks will fill the magic gauge and magic can be used to stun several enemies at once to perform a range of combos leading up to a very powerful finishing attack also over-reliance on anyone magic is inhibited due to enemies having immunity to certain elements later in the game of course it's not only imagine who can fight tipu has access to three separate attacks a normal one a thrust and a stealth takedown combat overall is very fun and well executed as you would expect there's several bosses that block the player's progression you don't simply hack and slash away at them it's mostly a combination of puzzles and combat that bring the basic mechanics to the forefront and really require both of the characters to be in sync while not exceptional taking its elements separately majin is a charming puzzler with solid gameplay backed up by respectable production value and a classic well told story it's a real pity it never got the attention it deserved back in the day there's no shortage of quality first-person shooters on the playstation 3. with the likes of resistance and killzone there were plenty of options when it came to choosing something to play one fps that never really got the chance to shine though was homefront it all centered around the cell of resistance fighters in colorado that battle for freedom in the north korean occupied america the premise was its main selling point and with the story being penned by the same guy who wrote red dawn and apocalypse now it's for sure one of the better aspects of the game even if it is a bit unbelievable several moments throughout the adventure are bound to stay with you long after you've put the controller down and in my eyes that's the sign of something special now you get all of the normal missions that come with a modern day fps like massive open gun fights stealth missions sniper runs in the odd vehicle point shoot and destroy measure and there's a nice amount of varieties of gameplay which is further pushed by the extensive range of weapons at your disposal but you're not alone joining you are a squad of teammates that manage to up the ante against the invaders but have all the intelligence of a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] wall you'll find them clipping into the floor or just straight up blocking your path forward at times but these small issues never really bog down the gameplay and just come off as a minor annoyance visually homefront isn't going to knock your socks off but it does succeed in creating believable environments and offers a glimpse of what an invasion of america might look like now it won't last very long as the game is rather short and with the only other option being an online multiplayer that's well and truly dead once you've completed the campaign there won't be anything else to do if you can look past this and also find a copy of the game for cheap it's worth picking up knight's contract introduces players to the stoic character of heinrich an executioner who is cursed by one of his victims as she dies and when the game starts he's 100 years older grey grizzled cursed with immortality and wearily walking the earth searching for someone who can break the curse heinrich ends up in the last place he ever expected employed by a resurrected gretchen the very witchy beheaded who cursed him gretchen is a powerful witch who can entangle enemies in magic summon meteor showers and make razor sharp blades appear from the earth the player controls only heinrich's physical movement he handles the attacks for both characters heinrich's abilities are mapped to the face buttons where holding down the right trigger transforms the buttons to gretchen's attacks now the battles are fast paced and even the smallest of encounters can be a heart pounding challenge heinrich sword slashers can be chained together easily enough even though gretchen's mechanics are mapped closely to heinrich's making her spells reach desired targets requires a bit of skill and a crab claw like grip on the controller as multiple shoulder buttons must be held prior to casting a spell it can be a bit awkward but it does get easier as the game progresses when it comes to presentation the evocative score and solid voice acting will pull you into the story and keep you wanting to move forward the problem is that issues with poor ai a pretty steep default difficulty setting and confusing level design often prevents you from doing so it's a shame as knight's contract has a lot going for it maybe if it had had a bit more time in the oven it would be received better when it released in my eyes it is still well worth playing back in 2004 sony released siren for the playstation 2 a very creepy survival horror game that took its inspiration from japanese horror movies unfortunately at least in america siren sold poorly and sony decided we were not worthy enough to receive its sequel however after four sirenless years sony announced bloodcurse a remake of the original and the first traditional survival horror game available on the playstation 3. now bloodcast is separated into 12 episodes each with four to six chapters each chapter has you completing a variety of objectives that can range from getting to a certain point in the area protecting or leading a secondary character through dangers or finding certain items original siren players should be prepared to recognize some of these objectives such as escaping from a special family there together blood curse gives you an excellent map system that you can access anytime by pressing select it lays out the entire area you're in quite nicely and points out landmarks and even tells you exactly where your objectives are while finding them is easy it's the way you can accomplish them in almost any way you want to that makes bloodcast special perhaps you can make some noise to lure them away or find an item to somehow make a smokescreen so you can slip in unnoticed finding your own way of completing these objectives gives you a nice sense of accomplishment and thankfully there's a very generous checkpoint system in place which definitely keeps frustrations to a minimum i can highly recommend blockers and it easily stands tall with the likes of silent hill and fatal frame despite some of its flaws its creepy atmospheric tension filled bloody and solid gameplay is well worth any horror finds time the tale series has long been a favorite amongst rpg fans from its first entry right up to the present day it's constantly evolved and improved over the years but like many long-running franchises there's always a few entries that fly under the radar now what made tales of graces a bit different was largely the narrative that managed to mix things up a bit by splitting the story into three separate acts you had childhood adulthood in the future with adulthood being the majority of the game getting to see each of the characters grow across the duration of the adventure really added to their believability and helped the warring kingdom that the events took place and come to life now all this wouldn't mean anything without some solid gameplay to back it up and thankfully grace's delivers there is a lot to do and explore as well as a generous amount of customization and many extra activities to complete that will keep you busy even after you finish the story the main game will take about 30 to 40 hours to complete which is a little shorter than some other jrpgs but if you're going after the side quests and secrets you can easily double that number when it comes to battles if you've ever played a tales game before you'll know exactly what to expect it's extremely engaging letting you string together combos like a madman in real time and change your strategies on the fly but rather than keeping track of magic points or tp the game employs something called the cc system basically cc is a stat that replenishes quickly in real time and is needed to carry out any of the actions you can perform in battle attack and deplete it with more powerful attacks costing more and some of them needing to be comboed into dodging a main feature of the battle system also costs cc but if you dodge just at the right moment you are actually awarded some it soon creates a fast and visceral experience overall tales of grace's f is a solid rpg and although it's not perfect the gameplay is fantastic if you never got round to playing it when it first released now is the perfect time to give it a go since its humble beginnings on the playstation 2 the yakuza series has gone on to become one of the most prevalent franchises today of course along the way a few games slipped through the cracks and dead souls is clearly one of them i think it's largely due to its completely different spin on the previous games which leaves behind the beater map style gameplay of the past instead opt in for an over-the-shoulder view but dead souls almost feels like a throwback to classic survival horror of its control scheme it honestly feels like a more advanced version of the controls in the original resident evil games and i'll admit at first it was jarring and clumsy but once you get used to it you'll be popping zombie heads off with ease in no time the narrative sees dead souls following multiple characters in their own experiences in a japan overrun by the undead each of them have developed wonderfully over the course of the game and all the side characters that populate their individual stories are written with such care and dedication that you sometimes forget that the game is actually about zombies now gameplay is a bit of a mixed bag the minutes minute gameplay is engaging and some pretty intense boss fights litter the adventure that really test the player's skill but on the downside it's one of those games that falls into backtracking hell and repetition almost refusing to divert from its beating path of killing a lot of zombies good job it's so much fun to do so with a wide variety of weapons available as well as a handy auto wing and a few special skills to help deal with larger groups it's never felt better mowing down hordes of zombies but that's not all there is to do a healthy amount of optional content is included as well as weapons to purchase upgrades to collect and much more that is bound to keep the average player rather busy if you aren't into story driven experiences dead souls may not be for you the game is heavy on the cutscenes and the control scheme definitely takes a while to get used to but that being said i found it to be an incredibly rewarding game featuring a rich plot filled with wonderful characters and memorable moments and in the end it's one of the better zombie games out there now there's plenty of unique games on the playstation 3 that's straight from the usual knobs but one that never got his chance in the sun has to be the last guy it sees you traveling the world and rescuing innocent people trapped by nightmarish insects and monsters that have laid siege to their cities this challenging game has an old-school vibe but manages to set itself apart by using real-world satellite imagery and while the concept isn't exactly new the use of real-world locations certainly provides for some interesting levels naturally the game takes place from a bird's eye view and gives the player the ability to zoom in close to the action or pan out for an overview of the entire city as the last guy your task is to move around the city gathering frightened civilians hide them in buildings and lead them to safety every person you save adds more to the trail of people behind you and it can be tough to get your control line to the escape zone as all levels have a time limit and rescue quilter if they are not met it's game over timing patience and a few tricks are required to truly master the game picking up only a few civilians at a time is not an option as most of the levels require a long line of hundreds or even thousands to complete keeping that long line together is going to be difficult especially on the later levels but to help keep things under control you were given a whistle that assembles them close together as well as being a means to warm off predators there's also a handy dash that enables you and your entire line to run past danger but it does drain stamina no old-school inspired game would be anything without items and power-ups and some of the items include stamina recovery monster freeze and the ability to walk back near to the safe zone using these items effectively is crucial for getting out of most of the cities before the timer runs out and with up to 15 in total there's plenty included to keep players busy if you've never got around to playing this one back in the day now is the perfect time to jump in and try it for yourself if there was one word that could describe killer as dead it would have to be weird but with it coming from the rather eccentric suda 51 you wouldn't expect any different it has a striking visual aesthetic that gives the game a sense of style in not just its presentation but also in the combat however underneath the stylish veneer there is a convoluted story and certain gameplay mechanics that are bound to raise an eyebrow or two it sees you've taken on the role of mondo as you set out to fulfill several assassination contracts if i'm being honest hillary's dead story is a nonsensical mess that fails to offer any sort of real explanation for a majority of the events that happened during the game but thankfully the gameplay more than makes up for it it's very reminiscent of no more heroes mondo's primary weapon is a katana and you can perform special finishes on the enemies just like travis and no more heroes what makes hillary's dead's combat different though is mondo's cyberneticon which can morph into four different weapons that are unlocked through completing the side missions the four weapons require blood in order to be used which can all be picked up from fallen enemies but that same blood mondo collects can also be used to heal himself as such some strategy is involved in deciding whether to use your weapons or heal mondo if your health is running low but an important part of killer's death combat is dodging because it allows mondo to continue building up a combo once the combo meter is high enough you can perform a finisher that grants you a different bonus depending on which one of the face buttons you pressed overall the confusing story short length for weird side missions of killer is dead bog down what is an otherwise enjoyable game the combat is fun and the visuals are gorgeous but the story will leave you confused and constantly wondering what the hell is going on if you can look past that aspect of the game hillary's dead is well worth giving a go well that does it for

the playstation 3 was no stranger to quality first-person shooters but when it comes down to sheer visual fidelity killzone 3 presents itself as one that fully succeeds in this category by portraying a gritty and realistic take on the genre now the amount of detail is insane from the debris flying all over the battlefield to the dynamic particle effects and intricately smooth weapon animations it all comes together to result in one of the finest looking games on the system now unlike killzone 2 the third outing offered a lot more variety when it came to the locations that make up the adventure from strange alien worlds to the snow-filled landscapes of the arctic each of them are incredibly rich thanks to the amazing lighting textures and many small details that comprise them as a whole but once you start engaging enemies in combat this is where killzone 3 really comes into its own at times there is so much happening on the screen that it is easy to get lost but this aspect really contributes to the feeling of being on a battlefield and as a result no matter how insignificant the type of enemy you come up against is it always feels challenging and immersive if you're a fan of first person shooters and are looking to get into one on the playstation 3 then this one is well worth checking out the playstation 3 was home to a generous selection of rpgs but one that continues to impress to this day has to be ninokuni working alongside level 5 studio ghibli had a hand in creating the incredible art style that nino kuni presents the cel-shading aesthetic makes all of the environments come to life in a world that is rich and vibrant everything is vivid with each and every character possessing their own distinct identity and style that lends the experience a real charm not often found in others on the market one of the most impressive achievements though is that despite being inside the gorgeous animated world there is a strong sense of realism the cutscenes contribute to this aspect and are always a real treat to watch a good number of scenes are fully animated while many more are rendered by the game engine that still manage to hold the bars set by ghibli but given the nature of the game's visual style in-game rendered scenes can look perfectly natural and it's fluid as well if you were to freeze frame during one of these scenes or even during normal gameplay it can sometimes be hard to distinguish it from the cuttings because of this ninokuni is a really immersive adventure and is bound to draw you into its world in the events that took place but for fans of studio ghibli it can be far more than that because it can easily give you the feeling that it all takes place inside one of their movies if you're a fan of the genre and still haven't got around to playing it nino cooney is quite easily one of the finest rpgs on the system that well and truly deserves your time the metal gear series has always been on the cutting edge when it comes to graphical presentation hideo kojima introduced us to the cinematic experience on a level we had never seen before many games before it had wonderful presentational aspects but none had the coolness of hollywood implemented in such a masterful way from the first entry right up until the last each game has consistently pushed the boundaries of the machine that it's developed on a metal gear solid 4 continued this trend it managed to push the series forward in a number of meaningful ways the first characteristic many will notice is the sheer diversity of locations you'll be visiting throughout the adventure from the scorching sun of the middle east to the blistering cold of shadow moses with a variety of weather effects and dynamic lighting playing a key role in bringing them to life the attention to detail in the environment is unmatched leaves blowing in the wind water ripples and hdr lighting along with all the little unique details the developers took the time to model it's just absolutely incredible as with the previous games in the series a variety of cutscenes portray their narrative and in true kojima fashion they are all directed with the usual flare and finesse many gamers have come to expect metal gear solid 4 will continue to stand as one of the greatest achievements on the playstation 3.

if you've never got around to playing it for yourself the perfect time to do so would be right now like many players out there i've always had a bit of a checkered history when it comes to final fantasy 13. there is no denying that from a gameplay perspective the game failed on many levels but when looking at the experience solely in terms of graphical fidelity without question final fantasy 13 is one of the most graphically breathtaking games on the system everything you see everything you do and everything that exists is painstakingly detailed and full of character each member of the cast as well as enemies and locations brought the series soaring into the modern hd era with the usual flair square nx it becomes so well known for as with previous entries there's a ton of fmv sequences that help convey the story some of the in-game scenes almost look like an fmv within themselves from the design the character placement the lighting they were all pretty convincing thanks to the engine that the game used once in battle though the game truly comes into its own each attack and magical ability would light up the screen in style and lend a real weight to each enemy encounter bits of cast magic would remain lodged on the field gigantic summon monsters animated with all the grace and fluidity as any real-life creature might as with the characters and monsters themselves it really was a real visual feast but it's just a shame the story and general setup of the adventure would hold the experience back resulting in what felt like a linear and at times mundane experience the uncharted series has become one of sony's flagship titles and with each new release has continued to refine the formula that makes it up a hallmark of the franchise is the impeccable presentation and uncharted 3 is no exception the third outing sees nathan drake set out on another globetrotting adventure with a bunch of impressive environments for it all to play out in from the dingy back alleys of london to the sweltering heat of the sahara each of them are lovingly presented and detailed with them all offering a whole range of gameplay possibilities for players to take advantage of now naughty dog proved with among thieves that the playstation 3 is capable of putting out some unbelievable visuals and with drake's deception they let out the rest of the tricks they had up their sleeve blistering sandstorms to rushing waters and burning buildings and with the amount of enemies and effects on screen at any one time helped push the game into something truly memorable the series has become well known for its insane set-piece moments and drake's deception delivers on this aspect wholeheartedly as well each of the character models were nothing short of extraordinary with the way in which they are animated only complementing the overall quality of their design uncharted 3 still stands as a testament to the talent of the team behind it and is truly still impressive to this day gran turismo has always had a reputation for the incredible visuals that each and every iteration produces right back to the first game in the series on the playstation one it has always prided itself upon providing one of the most realistic simulations of the sport and the 6th century is no deviation from this rule after the somewhat lackluster attempt with gran turismo 5 the next installment delivered on what racing fans have been waiting for visually gran turismo 6 is to the playstation 3 what god of war 2 was the playstation 2 a late technical triumph that took advantage of the system's hardware in many unique ways it presents itself in a stable 60 frames per second and 1080p resolution which results in some of the cleanest and smoothest imagery you'll see on the playstation 3.

various new techniques were deployed such as improved textures and a completely revamped lighting engine that helped each track and car come to life in a way that had not been seen from the series in the past of special noteworthy cards and although not all of them were modeled completely from scratch the ones that were looked absolutely incredible every aspect was lovingly recreated from the subtle details of the interior to the slick and smooth textures of the exterior seeing it in motion was a real sight to behold and lent the on-screen racing even more realism if you're looking for a racer on the playstation 3 and don't want to settle for anything other than the best then gran turismo 6 would be a great choice grand theft auto 5 has released for a whole range of consoles at this point that all clearly offer a superior experience than the playstation 3 release but not including it would be doing a disservice to the clear level of craftsmanship that went into developing it for the system now rockstar have always been masters of open world design and grand theft auto 5 saw everything they had learned up until that point being implemented to create the city of los santos the first thing to note is the size of the environment and the range of different locations within it from the dense urban scapes of downtown to the more rustic and rural nature of the outback the amount of detail packed into each really helps the city feel like a living and breathing space just like most games in the series you can expect to find a wide array of vehicles in which to use that are remarkably detailed and designed as well as a series of weapons that allow you to lay waste to the entire city and watch the various explosions and particle effects light up the screen in a spectacular fashion it's all presented in 720p and manages to hang around 30 frames per second whilst playing naturally the more actions you carry out on screen it's more prone to various dips but nothing that will likely pull you out of the adventure like i mentioned earlier you can now play it on a variety of superior platforms but there is no denying that grand theft auto 5 on the playstation 3 is something truly special when you consider the wealth of content and detail that the city of los santos provides let's get the obvious out of the way first when it comes to god of war on the playstation 3 the third entry in the series is objectively superior to ascension from a gameplay standpoint but for what it lacks in originality and narrative it more than makes up for in graphical prowess ascension is a gorgeous jaw-dropping game it's no surprise either as it released towards the end of the playstation freeze life cycle so santa monica pulled out all of the stops when it comes to the visuals present in the game rain wind and fire effects are spectacular as well as each and every character model that possesses a level of detail not often seen on the system but perhaps the most impressive aspect is the environmental design and the true sense of scale that manages to portray kratos travels through over and around some absolutely gigantic areas and each time you'll want to take a second to marvel at just how amazing the surroundings look matching all of this are the buttery smooth animations that feel incredibly responsive and tight you'll be taken out wave after wave of enemies in style thanks to the generous amount of abilities the game provides you it really does make the combat the true star of the show and cements ascension one of the most impressive titles on the system like i said god of war 3 is clearly the better game but when it comes to visuals there is no denying that ascension is still one of the best looking games to come out of the series after several successes with the uncharted series naughty dog took their tried and tested formula and produced what is arguably the best game on the system now much like the uncharted series before it an intense focus upon graphical presentation is at the forefront of the experience due to the subject matter each environment has been left to the mercy of nature resulting in urban landscapes that look absolutely breathtaking there will be times you'll have to just stop and use the camera to fully take in each surrounding it helps the world of the last of us feel like a real place and goes a long way in contributing to the narrative as you would expect each member of the cast sees the same level of detail lent to their appearance as well as the way in which their movements are animated there really was nothing like this before with joel seamlessly interacting with the environment and enemies it resulted in every single encounter raising the tension no matter how big or small thankfully a remastered version was released for the playstation 4 and is the best way to play it today but there is no denying what naughty dog achieved on the playstation 3 with the last of us it feels like a real swan song for the console and is a testament to the talent of the team behind it quantic dream have always excelled at creating some of the best cinematic games on console beyond two souls saw players taken on the role of a girl named jody as she unravelled an intriguing mystery that blended both the world of the living with that of the dead upon booting it up it soon becomes apparent that a lot of love and attention has gone into the visual design of the experience at the time of its release it genuinely looked like a next-gen game and was largely achieved by including borders on both the top and bottom of the image so more effects and detail could be lent to the on-screen action due to the smaller resolution but the most impressive aspect of the visuals have to be the level of detail present in every character on screen with it being an experience all centered around a touching and moving narrative seeing each line of dialogue delivered in the way in which the emotion of each story beat is portrayed is truly breathtaking it results in you really connecting to each person you meet and helps the story shine well that does it for today's

yber ninja Guiden Z is a game that generated a lot of controversy for fans of the series upon its release many Ninja guid and purists complained that it deviated too far from the franchise's template but despite the changes it's still a solid experience that comes along with some Relentless action and impressive visuals that give the game a look and feel that can call its own you take up the role of yba and after being killed at the hands of the series main hero you find yourself being brought back to life by a mysterious organization right in the middle of a zombie outbreak it's now your job to clean up the streets and wipe out each and every one of them as you make your way through the city and thankfully you've got one of many ways to do so with the combat having a rapid somewhat button matching quality to it that doesn't make the game easy necessarily because while almost no single enemy is a major fret in and of itself you're frequently surrounded by hordes of them when you start to deal out combos you'll find your life dropping rather quickly but it can easily be replenished by pulling off an execution skill where the camera pans in to reveal some rather impressive and fluid animations where yba completely decimates his Target in one of several unique ways yba ninja guide and Z is probably not going to appeal to everyone the humor is often crash the main character is one that a lot of people will struggle to get behind and the style has a more button bashing feel to it than fans of the series are used to it's not the longest game either with it being able to be completed in a rather short period of time but if you're looking for a game that's easy to lose a few hours to or a completely different take on the tried and tested formula of the series past then this is definitely one that's worth checking out during the late 2000s third person shooters saw a boom in popularity and to be fair many of them were simply generic knockoffs of far greater experiences but some will come along with a few interesting ideas of their own and this is where fracture comes into play it takes place far into the future where the player takes up the role of jet a soldier tasked with taking down a dictator who's hell bent on destroying America at the center of the game is the concept of manipulating the environment around you in order to use it as a weapon itself or a means to evade gunfire completely the ability to experiment with the environment in this manner makes the power fun to have but the fact that the enemy can also alter the terrain adds a huge sense of challenge to the game apart from this ability weapons naturally play a huge role with you getting the standard load out including machine guns rifles or rocket launchers but as you delve deeper into the game the Weaponry starts to get really inventive and unique the load stone for example fires off a projectile that causes objects to gravitate towards a Target while it's mainly used as a tool to get platforms moving to a specific spot using it on enemies creates some rather humorous results overall fracture is a solid third person shooter and the hook of manipulating terrain to your advantage is used a lot in the game but it's used in a way that it really feels out of place or simply just there is a gimmick if you've all but exhausted the extensive range of similar games of its kind on the PlayStation 3 then fracture will feel like a fresh departure thus well worth making some space in your collection for legend of K is an action platformer that never really found its footing when it first released on the PlayStation 2 in 2005 it wasn't until 10 years later where it would get its chance to shine with a complete remaster of the original Adventure that sported improved visuals and gameplay that make it the best way to experience this often forgotten platforming gem Kay is essentially a kung fu fighting cat who lives in a peaceful village with his uncle and master until he has to set out to free the Kingdom from an evil sorcerer known as shun and his army of evil Rats the story is as cheesy as it gets which is kind of expected from a game like this but it's fun thanks to the larger Life characters you'll meet along the way which add a distinct amount of charm to the game script now the game starts off in a similar fashion to Zelda where you must acquire a sword and learn a few basic moves but the further you go on it becomes more of a platformer you'll Jump Around solve small puzzles that usually involve finding hidden statues and sometimes you'll even go through dungeons filled with obstacles to retrieve a key but where the game really comes to life is during combat and K's ability to pull off one of several special moves and Link together combos which feels incredible incredibly satisfying my only gripe with the game is that early on everything is varied in terms of gameplay but towards the end it tends to start focusing just on the combat and seemingly forgets many of the platforming and puzzle ideas from the early hours but it's nothing that completely ruins the game as a whole when it comes down to it it's clear that the style and story is more aimed towards a younger audience but the gameplay will appeal to platforming fans of all ages thanks to a variety of genres that keeps it from being just a kids game St s Sanctuary battle is a muso that closely follows the events of the anime show of the same name as with many games of its kind the goal is simply to mow down hordes of enemies that litter the battlefield and from a gameplay perspective it's all incredibly simple you've got light medium and heavy attacks which are all assigned to one of the face buttons allowing you to pull off some rather impressive combos with one of the several characters you have the choice of choosing another button allows you to pull off a special move providing you have enough Cosmo which is highlighted by a gauge on the screen and fills up with the damage you either deal or take allowing you to quickly come back from a sticky situation with one of several special techniques that light up the screen in style now one of the main issues with the game is that the AI of the enemies leaves a lot to be desired even at the highest difficulty settings your opponents will charge at you blindly from all sides in these cases the real challenge is to avoid their harmful attacks which is easier said than done since for some strange reason Namco decided to opt for a fixed camera that constantly frames your character without lock on system as well it can be hard to keep track of which enemy you're engaging at any given time it's not a deal breaker by any means but it's for sure something that the game would have benefited from from a graphics point of view the most common enemies all appear very similar with only the models of the main characters appearing highly detailed especially in the reproduction of the characteristic armors that distinguish their various traits what makes up for this is the sheer speed and amount of special effects and enemies on the screen at any one time it's quite easy to get overwhelmed but it betrays the intensity of the anime show perfectly allowing fans of the source material to feel right at home if you're looking for something that's fun and easy to pick up and play then Saint siia Sanctuary battle is a great choice pain at its core is a puzzle game masking is a violent action title even if all the violence is self-inflicted the premise is simple and sees you being presented with one of several environments where your character is loaded into a Human Slingshot and you must adjust your height and distance before launching yourself at one of many different targets but to be truly successful you'll have to master grabbing throwing and drifting is each of them guide your character towards their Doom all the more effectively and get them in just the right position to inflict the most amount of pain on them now there's three M modes to take on with pandemonium serving as the main event it's your typical arcade mode that has you hurling yourself at different things in the environment and seeing how many points you can get this mode is where you can unlock most of the bonus content which is tied in most cases to the points system of course you may be wondering how the point system works and it's very simple all you've got to do is cause the most pain bonus points for things like destroying certain body parts decapitation and getting run over by vehicles and the best way to rack up the highest scores with the game focusing on planning and executing the most cruel and painful route for your character imaginable it ends up feeling like a showcase for the Havoc engine that's at the center of all of the action and because of it no two launches are the same which helps keep the game fresh and entertaining for countless hours and those hours will take by totally unnoticed by all who are captivated by the engaging and wickedly fun gameplay to be fair I had pretty low expectations going into this one but it's easily become one of my favorite games on the system that's absolutely perfect to play with friends as it just never gets old for anyone familiar with Twisted Metal or karmagedon you'll know exactly what to expect when jumping into blood dry it's a vehicle based combat game with the goal being to mow down as many zombies as you can whilst racking up as many points as possible the real meat of the single player plays out in the tournament mode here you pick a character from his stereotypical lineup of Rogues whose attributes all seem to be limited to slow speed but with strong armor or fast with weak armor it would have been nice to see a bit more variation when it comes to this aspect of the game but thankfully the minute to- minute gameplay more than makes up for it once out on the road there's one of three different objectives tied to each event you've got checkpoint race capture the skull and an allout battle mode that sees you racking up the highest amount of points you can in a small window of time as you would expect you've got a wide range of weapons in order to fulfill your goal from Rockets to miniguns and even a special move for each character such as an artillery strike that makes small work of the zombies on the road one major issue though is that while most damage is done with weapons they seem to be in short supply across all of the different Arenas while power reps like repair kits and speed boosts are plentiful as you can imagine this does become a bit of an issue and takes away a lot of the fun is instead of firing off weens you're mostly relegated to Simply ramming into whatever you can for all its issues though there's still plenty to live and the presentation is easily one of the best aspects of the game the amount of zombies on screen at any one time is quite impressive and even though the frame rate does tend to dip at times it's nothing that ruins the overall flow of the gameplay despite its problems blood drive is still a decent game to make your way through especially if you're fond of the likes of Destruction Derby or Twisted Metal death's spank is an action PG and as you can imagine from its name alone it's got a pretty quirky sense of humor you play as death spank vanquisher r evil hero of the damn trodden and you're in search of something known as the artifact this journey takes you far and wide where you'll uncover plenty of opportunities to help NPCs with various tasks that only you are capable of doing when it comes to combat it's essentially a hack and slasher where you'll be able to use both ranged and melee weapons to take down numerous foes death spank himself has no magical abilities and though you do obtain items that behave like offensive spells by doing ranged Elemental damage they consume one charge per use and you don't really need them to beat the game on the plus side you can equip up to four different weapons and map each of them to one of the face buttons for quick access and as you take out enemies you'll be earning experience points of money which naturally go into improving your attributes and gear that can make a huge difference when faced with multiple enemies at the same time now the visuals in the game sport a cartoony almost playful look which fits in perfectly with the game's human tone death spank and many of the citizens around the world that he lives in are often disproportionate and have various characteristics that help each of them stand up making each and everyone you meet feel like an integral part of the world as a whole overall death spank is full of great writing and entertaining gameplay that's sure to please hacken slash fans unfortunately though there's not that much in the way of replay value as once you've made your way through at once there's pretty much nothing else to see apart from side quests which admittedly are quite repetitive regardless of that shortcoming spank is still one hell of a laugh to play through and it's something I can easily recommend you try out for yourself last Dimension is a tactical RPG that opens up on the eve of the world's destruction a rather cartoonish villain known as the end has set his sights on the earth and it's up to an elite team of soldiers to take him down for good in order to do so the hero show and his companions have to fight their way through a mysterious Tower filled with strange enemies while weeding up the traitors in their ranks the tower itself is divided into several floors with Main and side missions to be completed in a selected Squad of six characters each of them have their own unique abilities and attributes so selecting which one suit your approach is the ticket to dealing with the many battles you'll find yourself taken on they're all term based but action oriented where you take control of each character and can run around the battlefield with them as characters begin to trust and like each other they'll Provide support in the form of a satisfying followup attack and by positioning your team smartly and building these bonds you'll soon learn how to topple tough enemies with e fundamentally these fights are really enjoyable but what really makes them compelling are the individual characters everybody has a certain gift that adds value to their independently leveled skills examples include a fighter that uses teleportation to move like a puff of vapor and an assassin with the ability to levitate taking this further is the traitor system that isn't afraid to punish you for your mistakes the traitors you let live eventually turn on you leaving you to finally kill them in battle and if you grew up you're at a disadvantage with one less teammate this sense of real consequence is what really helps L Dimension Excel and it's a Testament of the game's characters that you'll never quite know who has it against you making for some rather interesting twists in the story Dust 514 was one of the PlayStation 3's most unique firstperson Shooters which was intricately tied into the hugely popular MMO Eve online the game play was your standard FPS fair that saw you running around an area with a team of players and taken out your opponents through various game modes with different objectives what really made it different to the run-of-the-mill shooters though was what you would be getting up to outside of combat the leveling system was so complex and intricate that the amount of depth available When developing your character was outstanding and gave the player the ability to perfectly craft one that matches their play style now with it being set against a Sci-Fi backdrop there was various unique versions of weapons that everyone knows and loves from simple handguns to snip sniper rifles and lasers but perhaps more importantly than the weapons themselves was the various pieces of equipment that you could bring along to each fight ranging from Deployable spawn points resupply stations gadgets that allowed you to pinpoint the location of enemy units tools that saw you being enabled to repair various Vehicles installations and the armor of players and much much more having a team that knew how to use all of this equipment and battle was essential for your success and always felt much more like Battlefield compared to the arcade f of Call of Duty unfortunately the servers were turned off a few years back and there's no way to enjoy this game today which is a real shame as I feel the unique setup of the game along with the Staggering amount of Freedom it offered is something that's largely missing from many of the big FPS games out there today remember me is an action adventure that takes place well into the future with a new technology that allows people to edit and share memories with one another is developed and integrated into society the player takes up the fight is Nilan a mysterious young woman who's trapped in a facility where her memories are about to be wiped thankfully she manages to escape and Ventures out into neop Paris where a journey of Revenge self-discovery and Justice begins on the gameplay front this is where remember me truly comes into its own the combat is easily the star of the show and is all built around a combo system that allows you to string together one of several attacks and deal some serious damage on the enemies that occupy the city what takes this system to the next level is the ability to build your own combos from scratch where some moves deal out more damage whilst others heal ning and she carries them up finding the right balance when building your combos is the key to formulating a formidable strategy in your attacks couple this with one of the several special moves that have beholden to a cooldown period and what you have is a very veratile system where the player is free to express their creativity now remember me is a beautiful game you'll notice the attention to detail the minute you start playing for the first time the lighting is solid the textures are crisp and animations are extremely fluid the impressive backdrops in outdoor areas make the environments feel genuine and exploring neop Paris is simply breathtaking at times it's clear that developers took a lot of care when designing the world and as a result making your way through it is never a dull experience remember me is easily a game I can recommend everyone tries out sure it has its flaws and is quite linear in its execution but the world the developers built far out ways to cons well that does it for today's video keep an eye out for part two

### Transcript
thank you RPGs have always been known to have their strongest roots in storytelling and thankfully Eternal Sonata stands shoulder to shoulder with best of them the story takes place with famous composer chapon lying on his deathbed three hours before his death during these three hours he dreams an extraordinary dream where he meets a variety of lovable characters in a gorgeous world of fantasy and music this game takes place in that dream and sees you taken up the fight as a young girl known as polka the combat and Eternal Sonata is surprisingly inventive and a breath of fresh air for a jrpg is essentially a mix of real-time and turn-based elements that blend together to create a smooth cocktail of action and strategy the way it plays out is you have an action gauge on the left side of the screen and this will give you either 5 or 4 seconds to move around the battlefield choose which items to use and which enemy to attack when you've landed an attack on an enemy it refills your action page very slightly but you'll still need to plan which enemies to attack wisely as if you run too far you may be left with enough time to only get in a couple of hits if you want to get in as many hits as possible because each time you connect with an attack your Echoes increase which is what you use to unleash devastating special attacks these Echoes are shared between all of your party members so planning when to save them and when to use them for other characters is vital visually the game is nothing short of phenomenal incredibly crisp visuals presented in a wonderfully Lush colorful palette extreme detail has been applied to every inch of the game world making sure that no matter where your vision drifts in a world of Eternal Sonata your eyes are always going to be pleased all in all Eternal Sonata is an incredible Adventure that is well worth seeking out if you're looking for an engrossing story but more importantly gameplay the first part of Resonance of Fate anyone will notice is the Saturn which is trias's second parade into a post-apocalyptic Humanity the heroes of Resonance of Fate Stay on Earth with all of mankind living upon an enormous and gravity-defying Tower by the name of Basil the higher up the tower you go the higher rapid class it gets conversely the lower you go the more dangerous it gets the death running rampant throughout the streets now the three main characters are a trio of mercenaries continuously hired by the upper class to do their dirty work there is a story behind all of these tasks however that the mercenaries have to go through though it's not what is most prominent taking a few ideas from the battle system of Valkyrie Profile and mixing them with Guild missions into a lesser extent The Living World of radiata stories triases created a hybrid of many of their previous games all rolled into one the battle system is a mix of real-time and turn based when your characters begin to move a meter depicting the amount of time they have left begins to count down when this hits zero their turn is over and the next one begins however you can also perform something called The Hero action which sends your character on a predetermined path that allows him or her to perform a string of high octane and stylish moves every Hero action removes one gem from that gauge and if the entire bar is depleted all of your characters enter a critical condition where the defense is drastically reduced and the bar itself May shatter you can restore these gems to the bar by killing enemies it's a rewarding and certainly difficult experience at first and when you'll want to master as quickly as possible the game shows that tradition is not necessary to make a fun game without a dark Resonance of Fate is a worthy addition to the trace brand and was a welcoming breath of fresh air Trinity Souls of zeld is an RPG set in a western fantasy setting with goblins elves and all sorts of magical nasties populating The Dungeons and Dragons type Universe coming from the team behind the Dynasty Warriors games they're no doubt guarantee that happens of Epic Proportion and Trinity Souls delivers this by the bucket load is essentially a prequel to the PlayStation 2 original the story is somewhat convoluted and utilizes cutscenes and stills to progress the tale of a cliched good vs Evil storyline but no matter how weak The Narrative may be gameplay is where it's at and on this front Trinity saw sights at its core Trinity is a traditional hack and slash role-player game that does require quite a bit of button matching when you faced on your foes thankfully though not all of your attacks have melee and your characters have access to Magic and some very impressive Weaponry as well as you progress through the game your characters are rewarded experience which then allows you to fine tune them and even though the gameplay was a traditional hack and slash system there is some strategy and tactics available to the player adding the ability to perform combinations spells and some Nifty quick time events and everything comes together rather well the boss battles are definitely the highlights of this game and can be quite difficult one feature with the boss battles is that when your foe is weakened a red Arcane Circle will be displayed which allows you to increase your damage you can also call upon the powers of all three of your characters to unleash a deadly attack in unison swiping between characters is done by the shoulder buttons that does add another element of strategy into the game as each character has different abilities and switching between them on the Fly feels intuitive and opens up a ton of options for combos even though Trinity Souls has its flaws it's still a respectable RPG that is well worth playing through enchanted Arms is very similar to Final Fantasy 10's concept of Final Fantasy 13 more recently actually it is even almost identical but I personally enjoyed it a lot more enchanted Arms doesn't try to be epic or overly melodramatic yet it still manages to be funny touching and compelling just like Final Fantasy you will move on forward from one location to the next you cannot Stray From the Path or go on exploring aside from getting a few treasure chests here and there the dungeons are pretty simple too and the game does feel like it could be long on the PlayStation 1 euro RPGs but I still loved my time with it enchanted Arms has a turn-based battle system that places each team on opposing sides of the grid characters move in a similar fashion to RPGs like the sky every character has an element which in turn has its opposite element fire versus water for example there are more nuances too direct and ranged attacks combination attacks support abilities and Powerful ex moves it is simple to understand and once you really get the hang of it you'll put some serious sports into characters moves when I was well into the game I always strived for the Singleton Victory where I wouldn't even give my opponents a chance to attack this not only made me feel much more rewarded for my well thought out strategy it also benefited my characters since they didn't lose any Vega points these are numbers you will need to watch carefully as you travel through dangerous areas if you have a love for RPGs then I strongly suggest in trying to dance it isn't flashy it follows some conventions but the battle system is extremely fun and rewarding offering up something that any fan of the genre can enjoy if you're at all familiar with the tale series you'll know exactly what to expect from Tales of Grace's act it sees you've taken up the role of a young man as well and after meeting a girl in a flower field who has no idea who she is asborn vows to protect and take care of her until she can find her family now Tales of Grace's fuses the CC system for its battles if you play Tales of hearts or the other spin-off karoro you should be a bit familiar with the CC system however both of those games were using the 2D linear approach of the older Tales games so this was the first time a tails game had used this setup with a 3D battle system at the same time the CC mechanic uses a value to determine how many actions you can perform at once TP is no longer used and instead uses higher amounts of CC to cast spells and arts certain accents like dodging an attack quickly guarding or defeating an enemy will instantly recover some of these points and allows you to clip your combo chain going also your Arts are now divided into two separate types A and B which deal physical and magical damage respectively your basic attacks will automatically change into different arcs based on which direction your analog stick is facing I honestly think the CC system is a good thing for the tale series it gives a real fluid feel to the gameplay as you chain a bunch of attacks and are given more opportunities to deal with harder enemies exploring the world inside tales of Grace's app is enjoyable and entertaining because there is so much to do but it can be fun to go after all the extra side quests and secrets as well there is also always a way to go back to places you were visited and became before just in case you missed a certain item on side quests overall Tales of Grace's app is an amazing RPG while the plot of the game is probably one of the weaker parts of the experience it's not enough to completely derail the game with the gameplay more than affects him any issues players can have with the narrative if you're looking for a solid RPG to get into on the PlayStation 3 Tales of Grace's app is a great option the witch and the hundred night is a fairly significant departure from neponiji's normal fare both in terms of gameplay and its narrative content it revolves around the young lady known as Natalia who comes across as a rather nasty piece of work she's rude aggressive foul-mouthed and prone to bouts of violence a far cry from the usual trophy setups in many of nippon's other games the gameplay is basically a third person action RPG with an overhead perspective the combat itself is reminiscent of the E-Series it's very smooth and enjoyable to play and allows you to strength gather different combinations of weapons for a huge amount of different types of combos that can exploit weaknesses of enemies in a certain area there's also a Dodge roll for dodging attacks which can make the game go into slow motion when you've Dodger at the right time before an attack hits you as the player Carries On The Adventure they've been switching to different forms that specialize in different types of weapons and skills as well as deploying magical servants called touch codes that function as special Stills and battle helpers overall it's really fun and different and the amount of randomized loot only adds to the uniqueness of your character and their load up but the problems with gameplay mainly come from the technical side rather than design problems for one the camera can be hard to maneuver at times with no options with just the sensitivity it felt somewhat slow and clunky to turn it around and I wish it could have been a bit faster of course it's not a complete write-off because of this and can easily be overlooked as a slight annoyance that doesn't ruin the game of halt for those willing to invest some time and give Natalia the love shoot clearly a most desperately needs there's a lot to life here fairy fancy f is an RPG that sees you taking up the fight as fan an apathetic young man with no real aspirations other than to eat and sleep as much as he pleases whenever he wants he stumbles upon a Muslim town where they just so happens to be a sword stuck in a rock that no one can pull out of course it wouldn't be much of an adventure of our hero couldn't pull the sword from the stone so he gives it a try and Yanks it right out Al pops a fairy inhabiting the sword who informs fan that he is now destined to become a fencer which is someone who runs around the world in an attempt of collecting all 100 fairies in order to wake up a goddess now I'll be honest with you the main storyline isn't too creative however the interactions between individual characters is actually quite entertaining it's a long story of course in true jrpg fashion expected 30 plus hour campaign so you'll definitely get your money's worth now combat is a turn-based affair as you can move around anywhere within a predetermined circle before deciding to attack cast the spell wait it or try to escape alongside your basic attacks you also have to build up something known as a tension meter which increases by ticking or causing damage and once it is at a high enough level you're able to fairy eyes you are shown that short action sequence in which the character that is fairy eyes and strikes a pose flings their weapon High into the air and gets impaled by it on its way down it transforms your character into what part machines looking whiter and of course you do a hell of a lot more damage than State taking too much damage will cancel the effect out however and you can cancel out of it at any time to save your attention meter for later this adds a nice amount of strategy to the system if you're a jrpg fan you simply cannot get enough this is an easy pickup types of Destiny revolves around two best friends Hayden and Sonja who find themselves trapped in the same body and magically transported to a different version of their home Island like Rune Factory 3 before it tides of Destiny features a quest board that helps to guide the player through the game's many tasks although there are a few simple fetch or Monster slaying quests most quests involve at least some story that helps the player get to know the game's town for better quests also lead the way to advancing the game's storyline which involves Aiden and Sonia's quest to separate back into two people by searching the ocean and discovering what's out there at this point the Rune Factory series had been slowly improving its approach to combat with tides of Destiny offering much more freedom when it comes to the systems in place for the first time the main character could jump an Aiden's acrobatic double jump pipsy player a ton more control over battles than previous games did no longer will you become stuck in the corner surrounded by monsters that constantly enter direct your attempt to use a healing potion instead Aiden can use his jumps to get out of Corners Dodge enemy attacks and even attack them change direction amid it Beyond jumping tide of Destiny's combat is Swift and fluid even providing special attacks that are learned as Adam becomes more proficient with specific weapons it's still a fairly simple combat system of fast weapons continue to beat slow weapons due to a lack of defensive moves but it's more fun and interesting than ever before in the Rune Factory series of course it wouldn't be room factory without an abundance of other activities to take part in such as forging cooking medicine milking crafts and carpentry of these forging cooking and crafts are particularly important as they are the main ways to improve Aiden's equipment and keep him on top there's many ways to gather the necessary ingredients but mainly through items that enemies drop in shops which provides some of the more rare items if you're at all fond of the series or this type of RPG in general title Destiny is a solid option when nothing because something like it on the PlayStation 3.

Time and Eternity is an RPG that wins its inspiration on its sleeves mainly 80s Japanese anime which permeates the entire experience for those who remember the arcade classic Dragonslayer then the art Direction in this game will be a pleasant surprise instead of focusing strictly on 3D models the developers decided to take on the challenge of creating every single character in a fully animated fashion it's a real sight to behold especially with its 80s anime aesthetic all of the characters enemies and NPCs are drawn in this style meaning that this winter go on to become a pretty divisive game if you hate the style you'll quickly hate the game if you love the style however you won't be able to Pat it down the story sees you taking up the part of a princess Toki who must travel through time to stop her wedding from being attacked and thus prevent the death of her groom Tower after some magical Shenanigans take place he ends up inhabiting a pet dragon the princess songs it's a bit messy if I'm being honest but the gameplay is what saves the adventure from becoming another cliched RPG as the combat is where Time and Eternity really comes into its own Random Encounters play out in a one-on-one manner quite reminiscent of the classic Punch-Out games tying in cleverly to the idea that the two must always fight as one Toki and TOA each have their own skill tree so you have the freedom to build them as you see fit give or take a few character-specific branches admittedly Time and Eternity is not going to be for everyone there's some who will absolutely love its unique battle system and others who will be captivated by its visual presence and vice versa in my opinion it's well worth giving it a go if there is one RPG on the PlayStation 3 that deserved a ton more attention than what it initially received it has to be game Republic's folklore the first aspect of the game that will likely hit you is the rather mature storyline that deals with many Concepts like unconscious thoughts memories life and death that nearly anyone who plays it will be able to relate to it all begins with our two protagonists Ellen and kids being drawn to a mysterious location known as the village of Dublin which is said to allow people to travel to other Realms during the daylight hours you'll move your character around this desolate Village talking with various Shady residents and finding out various Clues to unravel the mysteries of the Netherworld when Nightfall arrives The Village residents are replaced by creatures known as half-lives creatures born from human emotions who enjoy hanging out with the local pub when you're ready you can present your Memento and journey to the chapters neverworld realm in the realm your character must battle against the creatures that inhabit it known as folks your is to collect these folks and use their abilities in battle to defeat and collect other monsters once you've got a good bunch of them on your side you can press the L2 button to access the folk menu and easily assign whichever ones you want to the face buttons this simple but intuitive mechanic gives the player a ton of creativity when it comes to approaching battles there's at least 100 available folks all with a list of unique abilities that can be combined with each other which are almost endless and help keep combat from ever feeling repetitive I believe however that the most impressive artistic feature in folklore is the designs of the folks themselves almost every folk has Unique Designs and animations you'll be hard-pressed to find more creative looking creatures if you pass you by back in the day there's never been a better time than now to try it out for yourself well that does it for today's video keep an eye out for part two as that will be coming up soon so don't forget to subscribe and hit that Bell to get notified about new videos which release every Monday and Thursday you can follow me on all of the social which are linked below to stay up to date and also join my growing community on Discord to meet many like-minded payments to continue the conversation with I'd like to give a special shout out to my patreon supporters Rhino skill gym Steve Richard Amy Daniel Paul Dio Oma awesome jacket dude Pierre Carl Strider GameCube Galaxy and Paddy J for their continued support helps make these videos possible if you're interested in joining my Discord or supporting the channel through patreon you'll find all of these links down below as always thanks for taking the time to check the video out I'll catch you next time foreign
